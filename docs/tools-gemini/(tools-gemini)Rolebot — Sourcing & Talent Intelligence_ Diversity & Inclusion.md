RESEARCH TOOL: Rolebot (Acquired by Visage)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE CONVERGENCE OF AI AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IN TALENT SOURCING

The talent acquisition landscape has historically oscillated between two extremes: the high-touch, high-cost model of executive search firms and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO), and the low-cost, high-volume approach of automated job boards and keyword scrapers. In late 2025, a significant market consolidation occurred that attempts to bridge this dichotomy. Rolebot, a pioneer in AI-driven "passive talent" discovery, merged with Visage, a platform known for its global community of human sourcers and crowdsourcing infrastructure.1 This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the combined entity, which operates under the Visage brand while leveraging Rolebot's proprietary "look-alike" algorithmic engines.

For the mid-market HR leader (50-500 employees), this merger represents a pivotal shift in procurement strategy. No longer is the choice between a software tool that generates hundreds of unvetted leads and a service provider that delivers a handful of candidates slowly. The Rolebot-Visage integration promises a hybrid ecosystem: Rolebot’s AI provides the immediate, top-of-funnel velocity by scanning millions of data points to identify potential matches in minutes, while Visage’s human layer—a network of over 4,000 vetted sourcers—provides the critical "last mile" of candidate verification and cultural calibration.3

This report dissects the technical architecture, commercial implications, and operational realities of adopting this platform. It moves beyond marketing claims to scrutinize the efficacy of "Sourcing on Autopilot," the validity of "Diversity by Default" guarantees, and the true total cost of ownership for organizations in the UK, US, Canada, and Australia. The analysis suggests that while the "Rolebot" name is fading into the Visage brand architecture, its core technology—specifically the ability to source without job descriptions via profile matching—remains a distinct and powerful differentiator in a crowded HR tech stack.

Short Description

"AI-powered passive talent discovery engine enabling 'sourcing on autopilot' with human-in-the-loop verification for mid-market teams."

Long Description

Core Functionality and The Paradigm Shift

Rolebot, now the intelligence core of the Visage platform, fundamentally disrupts the traditional recruitment workflow by reversing the standard sourcing logic. Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and sourcing tools like LinkedIn Recruiter rely heavily on keyword-based Boolean searches. This method is inherently flawed; it depends on candidates self-reporting skills accurately and recruiters constructing perfect search strings. It often results in "false positives" (candidates who have the keyword but not the capability) and "false negatives" (qualified candidates who use different terminology).

Rolebot addresses this by utilizing a "Look-Alike" matching algorithm. Instead of parsing a static job description (JD)—which is often rife with bias and poorly defined requirements—the system asks the recruiter to upload the profile of an "ideal employee." This could be a top performer currently in the role or a "unicorn" candidate found externally.4 The AI then analyzes over 100 distinctive data points associated with that profile, including career trajectory, educational background, digital footprint (GitHub repositories, Behance portfolios, Doximity profiles), and patent filings. It builds a predictive model of success and scours the open web to find passive candidates who mirror that specific DNA.7

Key Differentiators in a Crowded Market

Contextual AI over Keyword Matching: The system’s primary differentiator is its ability to understand context. For example, identifying that a Software Engineer who moved from a Junior to a Senior role in 18 months at a high-growth startup likely possesses high agility and learning potential, even if specific keywords are missing from their summary. This allows the tool to surface "hidden gems" that standard scrapers miss.

The "Human-in-the-Loop" Verification Layer: While Rolebot provides the AI engine, the merger with Visage introduces a critical quality control mechanism previously absent in standalone AI tools. Visage maintains a global community of over 4,000 freelance sourcers and recruiters. These human experts review the AI-generated matches for nuance, soft skills, and cultural indicators that algorithms currently struggle to interpret. This hybrid approach aims to deliver a "calibrated" list of candidates, reducing the recruiter's rejection rate significantly.1

Autonomous Engagement ("Wooing"): The platform does not stop at identification. It includes an automated engagement layer designed to "woo" passive talent. Once a recruiter marks a candidate with a "thumbs up," the system initiates a personalized, multi-channel outreach sequence. These sequences are optimized for response rates, using data-driven subject lines and send times to maximize the probability of engagement from candidates who are not actively looking for work.4

Structural Diversity Guarantee: Perhaps the most significant claim is the platform's ability to structurally engineer diversity into the pipeline. The algorithm is programmed to ensure that at least one-third (33%) of the candidates presented in every batch are from underrepresented groups. This is not a filter that recruiters can toggle off; it is a foundational element of the sourcing logic, ensuring that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) goals are met systematically rather than aspirationally.4

Target Users and Strategic Value

The platform is specifically engineered for Talent Acquisition Leaders and Heads of People in mid-market organizations (50-500 employees). These companies typically face a specific set of challenges: they lack the massive employer brand of a Google or Amazon to attract organic talent, yet they have high-volume or highly specialized hiring needs that outstrip the capacity of a small internal recruiting team.

Workflow Integration: The user interface remains deceptively simple, often described as "Tinder for Recruiting." A recruiter logs in, sees a daily batch of AI-curated and human-verified profiles, and makes binary decisions (Interested/Not Interested). The system learns from these interactions, refining its "look-alike" model in real-time to improve future accuracy.4

Technological Underpinnings: The stack utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse unstructured data from the open web, combined with predictive analytics to estimate a candidate's "availability" or propensity to move. This "move-ability" score helps prioritize outreach to candidates who are most likely to respond, optimizing the recruiter's time investment.1

SECTION 2: COMPANY SIZE & REGIONAL FIT

Confidence Level: HIGH

The strategic merger of Visage and Rolebot has expanded the total addressable market (TAM) for the platform, allowing it to service a broader spectrum of company sizes and geographies than either entity could achieve independently.

Ideal Company Sizes

The analysis of pricing structures, case studies, and feature sets indicates a strong fit for the mid-market, with emerging capabilities for the enterprise.

[ ] 1-50 employees: Supported but less common. For very small startups, the cost of a dedicated sourcing automation platform may outweigh the benefits unless they are in hyper-growth mode (e.g., VC-backed tech startups needing to hire 10 engineers in a quarter). The entry-level pricing (~$1,400/mo) is a significant commit for a small business.

[x] 51-200 employees: Primary Sweet Spot. Organizations of this size typically have a small HR team (1-3 recruiters) that is overwhelmed by administrative tasks. They cannot afford an RPO but need the throughput of a larger team. Rolebot/Visage acts as a "force multiplier," effectively adding a virtual sourcing team for the cost of half a headcount.11

[x] 201-500 employees: Primary Sweet Spot. At this scale, companies often have formalized DEI targets and continuous hiring needs across multiple departments. The platform's ability to pipeline passive talent becomes critical here to reduce reliance on expensive contingency agencies.9

[x] 500+ employees: Strategic Growth Area. The press release for the merger explicitly positions the combined entity to serve "Fortune 100" companies. The inclusion of SOC 2 Type II compliance and SAP SuccessFactors integration (via the SAP Store) signals a deliberate move upmarket to serve global enterprises like Siemens, Ford, and Snowflake.1

Company Size Notes:

While marketing materials target "all sizes," the operational reality suggests that the efficiency gains are most palpable for companies with continuous hiring needs. A company hiring sporadically (1-2 roles per year) would likely find the subscription model less economical than a transactional agency fee. Conversely, a 200-person company growing at 20% year-over-year represents the ideal use case, where the "always-on" pipelining justifies the recurring cost.

Supported Regions

[x] UK

[x] US

[x] EU

[x] Australia

[x] Canada

[x] Global

Evidence and Regional Nuances:

Global Sourcing Community: Visage’s core differentiator is its distributed network of sourcers located in over 65 countries. This provides inherent coverage for all major time zones and linguistic regions, allowing for "follow-the-sun" sourcing operations.3

European Presence: The platform has deep roots in the European market. Case studies reference ASML (Netherlands) and Siemens (Germany), and Rolebot was incubated in the SAP.iO Foundry in Berlin, indicating strong support for DACH and broader EMEA regions.1

Data Sovereignty: The platform’s adherence to GDPR is not just a compliance checkbox but a functional capability. It supports data residency requirements, which is crucial for UK and EU clients post-Brexit. The ability to source candidates globally while respecting local privacy laws (e.g., distinguishing between public data and private contact info) is a key selling point for multinational mid-market firms.1

North America: The US remains a primary market, with headquarters in the US and compliance with CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) enabling unrestricted operation across North American jurisdictions.15

SECTION 3: PRICING (CRITICAL)

Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

The pricing strategy for Rolebot/Visage is a departure from the traditional "seat-based" SaaS model, leaning instead towards a "slot-based" or "role-based" subscription. This aligns incentives with hiring outcomes rather than user adoption.

Pricing Model

Flat Rate / Subscription (Role-Based)

The dominant model is a monthly or annual subscription fee determined by the number of active roles (concurrent job openings) or interview slots rather than the number of recruiter seats. This is a strategic choice that encourages widespread adoption within a hiring team; a company can have 10 hiring managers using the platform without incurring additional per-user license fees, provided they stay within the active role limit.9

Detailed Pricing Notes

The "Month-to-Month" Advantage: Unlike competitors like LinkedIn Recruiter or HireEZ that often mandate annual upfront contracts, Visage historically emphasizes month-to-month flexibility.12 This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for mid-market companies who may be hesitant to commit to a 12-month contract for an unproven AI tool. It allows them to "pilot" the solution for a quarter during a hiring spike.

The "Performance" Component: Historical Rolebot pricing structures sometimes included performance-based elements, such as charging based on the number of interviews secured rather than just profiles viewed. While the merged entity likely standardizes on a SaaS subscription, this DNA suggests a focus on outcomes (interviews) vs. outputs (leads).

Entry-Level Tier (~£1,100/mo): This tier is designed for smaller organizations or specific departmental use (e.g., "We just need this for Engineering hiring"). It likely includes ~1-3 concurrent roles and access to the automated outreach engine.17

Enterprise Tier (~£2,360/mo): As listed on the SAP Store, this tier ($3,000 USD) unlocks the full power of the platform: unlimited user seats, higher concurrency of roles (5-10+), priority support from the human sourcing team, and advanced integrations (e.g., bi-directional sync with Workday/SAP).9

Volume Discounts: For companies requiring 20+ concurrent roles or enterprise-wide deployment, custom pricing is negotiated. The "setup fee" is almost invariably waived for these annual agreements.16

Contract Length Options:

[x] Monthly: A key differentiator for flexibility.12

[x] Annual: Standard for locking in lower effective monthly rates.9

[x] Custom: Available for large enterprise deployments.

SECTION 4: COMPLIANCE & CERTIFICATIONS (CRITICAL)

Confidence Level: HIGH

In the realm of AI sourcing, compliance is the single biggest risk factor. "Scraping" data from the web sits in a legal grey area, and storing candidate data without consent violates GDPR. The Visage/Rolebot entity has invested heavily in a "compliance-first" infrastructure to mitigate these risks for enterprise clients.

Compliance Documentation URL: https://www.visage.jobs/security-compliance/ 18

Strategic Compliance Analysis:

The platform's approach to "Legitimate Interest" under GDPR is sophisticated. By using human validators (Visage) to review AI-scraped data (Rolebot), the company adds a layer of due diligence that pure scrapers lack. Furthermore, the automated outreach sequences likely include opt-out mechanisms that immediately purge candidate data if requested, automating compliance tasks that would otherwise burden the HR admin. The "Diversity by Default" feature is also a compliance asset, providing a paper trail of inclusive hiring practices that defends against claims of adverse impact or bias.9

SECTION 5: IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

One of the platform's strongest value propositions is its "Plug & Play" nature. Unlike a full ATS migration which can take 6-12 months, Rolebot/Visage is designed to layer on top of existing infrastructure, minimizing disruption.

Timeline Estimates

Implementation Timeline Min: 1 Week

Scenario: A mid-market company using the web-based platform with standard email integration (Gmail/Outlook) and no deep ATS bi-directional sync. This involves simply creating accounts, setting up email templates, and uploading the first "ideal candidate" profiles.10

Implementation Timeline Max: 4 Weeks

Scenario: An enterprise deployment involving Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration, deep integration with a complex ATS (e.g., Workday or SAP SuccessFactors), and training for a large team of hiring managers.

Resource Requirements

IT Hours: Minimal (<5 hours). The heavy lifting is usually limited to whitelisting the application, configuring email DNS records (SPF/DKIM) to ensure high deliverability of outreach emails, and perhaps approving the API integration with the ATS.20

HR Admin Hours: Low-Medium (10-20 hours). The primary time investment is strategic, not technical. HR leaders must define the "ideal profiles" for open roles, write or approve the outreach copy (email sequences), and configure the diversity parameters.

Training: Minimal. The UI is deliberately designed for "self-service" simplicity. Rolebot’s interface is often compared to consumer apps (swiping/thumbs up), requiring virtually no training. Visage provides onboarding webinars to ensure best practices in "calibrating" the AI.21

Prerequisites:

Reference Profiles: The AI cannot work without a "seed." You must have LinkedIn URLs of ideal employees or candidates ready to upload.

ATS Admin Access: To enable the bi-directional sync, you need a user with Admin privileges in your ATS to generate API keys.

Job Requisitions: Clear understanding of the roles to be sourced; while JDs aren't used by the AI, they are needed for the human sourcers (Visage side) to understand nuances.

Common Delays:

Internal approval for API access: IT departments can be slow to approve 3rd party API keys.

Copywriting: HR teams often underestimate the time needed to write compelling, personalized outreach sequences that don't sound like spam.

Calibration: The first batch of candidates effectively "trains" the system. If the recruiter is slow to provide feedback (thumbs up/down) on this first batch, the algorithm cannot refine itself, stalling the implementation.22

SECTION 6: INTEGRATIONS

Confidence Level: HIGH

The integration strategy is "ATS-First." The platform acknowledges that while it handles sourcing, the ATS remains the "source of truth." Therefore, data must flow seamlessly between the two to prevent the "data silo" problem common with sourcing tools.

Other Notable Integrations:

Outlook / Gmail: Native integration for calendar scheduling and email syncing. This is critical for the "outreach automation" feature to send emails from the recruiter's actual address, not a generic alias.22

Zapier: Provides a "catch-all" integration method for connecting to niche tools like Google Sheets, Trello, or proprietary CRMs.28

Integration Notes:

The integration capability is not just about moving data; it's about workflow automation. The system can "read" the status of a candidate in the ATS. If a candidate is marked as "Hired" or "Rejected" in the ATS, Visage/Rolebot can update its own records to prevent resurfacing that person in future searches (Rediscovery prevention). This "bi-directional" capability is a sophisticated feature usually found only in enterprise-tier tools.23

SECTION 7: CASE STUDY & SOCIAL PROOF

Confidence Level: HIGH

The merged entity leverages case studies that highlight speed, efficiency, and cost reduction—the three pillars of the mid-market business case.

Primary Case Study: Cummins (Manufacturing / Enterprise)

Company: Cummins Inc. (Global Power Technology Leader, 50,000+ employees).

Challenge: The company relied heavily on an expensive RPO provider for niche executive and technical roles but suffered from low candidate quality and slow response times. They needed to bring sourcing in-house without exploding their headcount.

Solution: Deployed Visage/Rolebot to automate the top-of-funnel sourcing and initial outreach.

Results:

90% Profile Approval Rate: The internal team approved 90% of the AI/Human-sourced profiles, compared to just 60% from their RPO provider. This proves the "quality" of the look-alike modeling + human verification.

92% Contact Rate: Because confidence in the profiles was high, the team contacted nearly everyone presented (vs. 51% with RPO).

60% Open Rate: Automated outreach sequences achieved double the industry average (32%).

1.8 Days: Average time for candidate response.

Strategic Outcome: Cummins phased out their RPO provider and hired internal contract sourcers, significantly reducing their cost-per-hire.

Source: https://www.visage.jobs/customer/cummins-sourcing-case-study/ 34

Secondary Case Study: Charles River Laboratories (Pharma / Biotech)

Challenge: Needed to fill highly specialized Ph.D.-level scientific roles.

Outcome: Reduced time-to-hire to 2.5 months (exceptionally fast for this role type).

Metrics: "Crowdsourced 697 candidates, validated 258, committed 31, and shortlisted 22 candidates overnight." 22

Implication: This demonstrates the platform's ability to handle complex, non-tech roles where "keywords" often fail to capture scientific expertise.

Notable Customers:

Enterprise: Siemens, Ford, Snowflake, USC.

Tech/Mid-Market: Cornerstone OnDemand, Yelp, Fandango.

Healthcare: Allina Health (Visage Imaging arm, though brand overlap exists, the recruiting tool serves healthcare verticals heavily).

SECTION 8: CONTENT & MEDIA

Confidence Level: MEDIUM

Key Features & Capabilities:

AI "Look-Alike" Sourcing: Discards the Job Description. Users upload a "seed" profile (e.g., LinkedIn URL of a top performer), and the AI finds candidates with matching career arcs, skills, and digital footprints.4

Diversity by Default: A hard-coded algorithm guarantee that 33% of every candidate batch will be diverse. This removes the "opt-in" nature of diversity sourcing, making it a standard operating procedure.9

Automated Outreach Sequences: "Set and forget" drip campaigns. The system sends personalized emails on behalf of the recruiter and automatically stops when a candidate replies.

Global Human Validation: A network of 4,000+ human sourcers (Visage) vets the AI's output. This "Human-in-the-Loop" model filters out false positives that pure AI tools miss (e.g., a candidate who technically has the skills but just started a new job yesterday).3

Pipeline Analytics: Predictive insights that tell a hiring manager: "To make 1 hire for this role, you need 40 prospects and 5 interviews.".22

Passive Talent Focus: Specifically targets the 75% of the workforce not actively applying to jobs, accessing data points (patents, code repos, portfolios) that traditional job boards miss.8

Screenshots:

The UI is frequently described as having a "Tinder-like" interface for the initial review phase. Recruiters are presented with a daily batch of candidates and use a simple "Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down" mechanic. This binary feedback trains the machine learning model specific to that requisition.4

(Note: Direct image URLs were not retrievable, but the description is consistent across multiple sources).

Demo Video:

Rolebot Demo (G2): https://www.g2.com/products/rolebot/reviews (Embedded video showing the "seed profile" upload and "thumbs up" workflow).35

SECTION 9: REVIEWS & RATINGS

Confidence Level: MEDIUM

The review landscape is currently fragmented between the historical "Rolebot" entity and "Visage."

G2 Ratings:

Visage: 3.8 / 5.0 (12 Reviews) 36

Sentiment: Users praise the speed and "ease of use" (learning the tool in <5 seconds).

Criticism: Some pricing friction for small businesses ($50/mo starter mentioned in older reviews). Some users find the software "bulky" at times.

Note: Analysis reveals some reviews are misfiled (confusing the software with a video game named Visage); these have been excluded from the qualitative analysis.

Rolebot (Historical): 4.4 / 5.0 (4 Reviews) 9

Sentiment: Highly positive regarding the "plug and play" nature and the concept of "autonomous passive talent sourcing." Users specifically highlight the time savings of the automated outreach.

Capterra:

Visage: Mixed presence; often aggregated into broader HR categories. Reviews echo G2 sentiments regarding the efficiency of the human sourcer network.

Synthesis of User Feedback:

The prevailing theme is Time Savings. Recruiters value the tool not necessarily for finding better candidates than a human could ever find, but for finding them faster and handling the tedious outreach logistics. The "10 minutes a day" promise appears to be validated by user testimony. The primary friction point is typically Cost vs. Volume for smaller players—if you don't have enough roles to fill, the subscription feels expensive.

SECTION 10: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

Rolebot/Visage occupies a unique "Middle Ground" in the market. It is more automated than an agency but more service-oriented than a pure software tool.

Primary Competitors

hireEZ (formerly Hiretual):

The "Pure AI" Rival. hireEZ is the closest direct competitor for outbound sourcing. It excels at finding contact info and aggregating data from the open web.

Differentiation: hireEZ is a SaaS-only tool. You get the data, but you do the work. Visage/Rolebot adds the Human Validation Layer. A Visage sourcer actually checks the profile before you see it. This results in fewer "junk" profiles and a higher approval rate than hireEZ, though potentially at a slightly higher cost or slower initial turnaround (hours vs. seconds).37

Fetcher:

The "Automated Headhunter." Fetcher also promises automated sourcing and outreach.

Differentiation: Rolebot distinguishes itself with the "Look-Alike" modeling technology. Fetcher is often seen as "filters on autopilot," whereas Rolebot claims to understand the trajectory of a career. Rolebot’s deep integration with SAP SuccessFactors also gives it a defensive moat in the enterprise SAP ecosystem that Fetcher lacks.38

Greenhouse Sourcing Automation:

The "Native" Threat. Greenhouse has built its own sourcing tools.

Differentiation: Native tools are great for mining existing databases (Rediscovery). Rolebot is "platform agnostic" and focuses on net-new discovery from the open web (the "passive 75%"). It feeds the ATS rather than competing with it.27

Competitive Summary:

"Unlike hireEZ and Fetcher, which rely primarily on scraping and automated matching, the Visage/Rolebot platform employs a 'Human-in-the-Loop' methodology. This ensures that every AI-sourced candidate is vetted by a human expert before reaching your dashboard. For a mid-market leader, this means the difference between reviewing 50 'maybe' profiles from a software tool versus 10 'definitely' profiles from Visage."

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS

Overall Assessment: B+

The merged Rolebot/Visage platform represents a mature, sophisticated solution for the mid-market sourcing crunch. By combining the speed of Rolebot's AI (Look-Alike modeling) with the quality control of Visage's human sourcers, it solves the two biggest problems in recruiting: Volume (too much noise) and Time (too much manual screening).

Strengths:

Innovation: "Look-Alike" sourcing without JDs is a genuine innovation that reduces bias.

Compliance: SOC 2 Type II and GDPR compliance make it enterprise-ready.

Ecosystem: Deep, native integrations with major ATS players (Workday, SAP, Greenhouse).

Flexibility: Month-to-month contracts reduce buyer risk.

Weaknesses:

Brand Confusion: The market is still adjusting to the merger; documentation is split between "Rolebot" and "Visage."

Pricing Opacity: Post-merger pricing is becoming more custom/enterprise-focused, making it harder for smaller mid-market players to get quick quotes.

Recommendation for IndustryLabs Buyers:

For HR leaders at mid-market companies (50-500 employees) struggling to fill niche technical or professional roles, this tool is a Strong Buy. It is particularly well-suited for teams that cannot afford an RPO but need more throughput than their internal team can provide. The "Diversity by Default" feature alone justifies the investment for organizations with strict DEI mandates. Buyers should push for a pilot using the "Month-to-Month" option to validate the "Look-Alike" accuracy for their specific hard-to-fill roles before committing to an annual enterprise contract.

Vendor Verification Required:

Confirm the current status of ISO 27001 certification (distinct from SOC 2).

Verify if the entry-level ~$1,400/month pricing tier is still accessible for new customers post-merger.

Request updated implementation guides that reflect the unified platform workflow.
