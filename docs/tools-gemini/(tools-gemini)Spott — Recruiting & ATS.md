Spott: A Deep-Dive Vendor Analysis and Market Impact Report

Executive Summary

This comprehensive research report evaluates Spott, an AI-native Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform specifically engineered for recruitment agencies and executive search firms. As the recruitment technology landscape shifts from static systems of record to dynamic, AI-driven operating systems, Spott emerges as a significant challenger to legacy incumbents by embedding generative AI agents directly into the recruitment workflow. This analysis, based on verified documentation and comparative market data, assesses Spott’s capabilities, market fit, and total cost of ownership (TCO) for mid-market buyers.

The central thesis of this report is that Spott represents a paradigm shift in agency software—moving away from the "Frankenstein stack" of disjointed tools (ATS + Sourcing + Sequencing + Scheduling) toward a unified, AI-native platform. While this offers substantial efficiency gains and cost reduction, it introduces specific risks related to vendor maturity and enterprise-grade security certifications that buyers must weigh carefully.

Key Strategic Findings:

Market Positioning: Spott is purpose-built for external agencies, not internal corporate HR. Its architecture lacks the requisite HRIS integrations (e.g., Workday, BambooHR) and approval workflows necessary for corporate talent acquisition, making it a poor fit for internal HR teams but a highly optimized solution for profit-centric recruitment firms.1

Financial Advantage: With a transparent pricing model starting at approximately £810 per user/year, Spott significantly undercuts the total cost of ownership of legacy platforms like Bullhorn, which often require expensive third-party add-ons for essential features like automation and sequencing.3

Technological Differentiation: Unlike competitors that treat AI as a bolt-on feature, Spott utilizes "AI Agents" to automate complex cognitive tasks, such as generating formatted candidate reports and conducting natural language database searches, fundamentally altering the administrative burden on recruiters.1

Compliance & Risk: The company demonstrates strong GDPR compliance due to its dual-headquarters structure in Belgium and the US. However, the absence of verified SOC 2 Type II certification poses a procurement hurdle for large enterprise buyers in highly regulated industries.4

Product Description

Short Description (80 characters):

AI-native ATS/CRM for agencies automating sourcing, outreach, and reporting. 3

Long Description:

Spott positions itself as the operating system for the next generation of recruitment agencies, fundamentally reimagining the role of the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Traditionally, ATS platforms have functioned as passive data repositories—digital filing cabinets where recruiters manually log activities. Spott disrupts this model by functioning as an active, AI-driven partner that participates in the recruitment workflow.

At its core, Spott is an AI-native ATS and CRM designed to consolidate the fragmented tool stack typical of modern agencies. Recruitment firms often rely on a patchwork of subscription services: a CRM for data storage (e.g., Bullhorn), a sequencing tool for outreach (e.g., SourceWhale), a scheduler (e.g., Calendly), and a transcription tool (e.g., Otter.ai). Spott integrates these functionalities into a single platform, eliminating data silos and reducing subscription fatigue.1

Core Functionality & Technology Approach:

The platform’s architecture is built around three proprietary AI capabilities that distinguish it from legacy competitors:

Natural Language Sourcing: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Spott allows recruiters to query their proprietary database using conversational language (e.g., "Show me Java developers in London who have worked at Fintech startups") rather than complex Boolean strings. This democratizes data access, allowing junior recruiters to surface candidates with the sophistication of seasoned researchers.6

Automated Candidate Reporting (Spec CVs): One of the most time-consuming tasks for executive search firms is the creation of "Candidate Packets" or "Spec CVs"—formatted documents presenting a candidate to a client. Spott’s AI agent ingests raw CVs, interview notes, and job descriptions to generate these reports in seconds, adhering to the agency’s specific branding and tone. This feature alone targets a massive reduction in non-revenue-generating administrative time.1

Active Meeting Intelligence: Beyond simple transcription, Spott’s "Meeting Co-Pilot" joins candidate interviews via Zoom/Teams, transcribes the conversation, and—crucially—automatically updates the corresponding fields in the CRM (e.g., salary expectations, notice period) based on the dialogue. This ensures data hygiene without manual data entry, solving the perennial problem of "dirty data" in agency CRMs.7

Target Users:

The tool is explicitly and exclusively designed for Recruitment Agencies, Staffing Firms, and Executive Search Consultancies. It is engineered to support the workflow of "Headhunters" and "360-Recruiters" whose primary metric is placement revenue. It is not built for internal Talent Acquisition teams, as evidenced by the lack of internal approval chains, offer letter generation for payroll, or integrations with HRIS platforms like Workday.1

Key Differentiators:

Spott’s primary differentiator is its "AI-Native" status. While incumbents like Bullhorn are scrambling to add AI features via acquisitions or partnerships, Spott was built in the post-generative AI era (founded 2024), meaning its data structure is optimized for LLM interaction from day one. This allows for fluid agents that can "read" and "write" database entries autonomously, a capability that bolt-on AI solutions struggle to replicate due to legacy codebases.1

SECTION 2: COMPANY SIZE & REGIONAL FIT

Confidence Level: HIGH

Analyzing the vendor’s scale and regional focus is essential for determining its suitability for mid-market buyers who require a balance of agility and stability.

Ideal Company Sizes

Company Size

Fit Status

Evidence/Reasoning

1-50 employees

Ideal Fit

The self-service nature of the platform, combined with an accessible entry price point (€79/user), makes it an ideal fit for boutique agencies and startups. The "Essential" tier is specifically calibrated for this segment, allowing founders to start immediately without complex implementation contracts.3

51-200 employees

Strong Fit

This segment represents the "sweet spot" for Spott’s value proposition. Agencies of this size often struggle with the cost and complexity of enterprise tools like Bullhorn but have outgrown basic spreadsheets or lightweight ATSs. Spott’s "Pro" tier offers the sophisticated reporting and automation needed for scaling teams while maintaining a lower TCO. References like "Pauwels Consulting" fall into this mid-market category.5

201-500 employees

Potential Fit

While the feature set supports this scale, the implementation friction increases. Agencies with 200+ users typically have massive legacy databases and complex custom workflows. While Spott positions itself as a replacement for enterprise tools, buyers in this segment must carefully evaluate the data migration capabilities. The "all-in-one" promise is attractive here to reduce vendor bloat.1

500+ employees

Low Fit

Currently, the lack of explicit SOC 2 Type II certification and advanced enterprise permissioning documentation suggests Spott is less suitable for global enterprise agencies with strict procurement compliance requirements. These organizations typically require service-level agreements (SLAs) and dedicated support infrastructure that early-stage startups are still building.

Company Size Notes:

Spott is a Winter 2025 Y Combinator company, placing it in a hyper-growth phase.1 This implies a rapid release cycle of new features but also potential instability characteristic of early-stage vendors. For mid-market buyers (50-200), this presents a trade-off: they gain access to cutting-edge AI features and influence over the product roadmap, but they must tolerate the "growing pains" of a newer platform compared to a 20-year incumbent.

Supported Regions

Region

Support Status

Evidence

UK

Supported

The UK is a primary market for agency recruitment. Spott’s strong GDPR stance and ability to handle UK data residency requirements via its European infrastructure make it a viable choice. Currency conversion is straightforward, and the product is English-first.4

EU

Core Region

With one of its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium, Spott is natively aligned with European market needs. It is fully GDPR compliant, a critical non-negotiable for EU agencies. The dual HQ structure allows it to serve the EU market with local legal entities.1

US

Core Region

The company maintains a headquarters in San Francisco and is backed by Y Combinator, signaling a strong focus on the North American market. It is CCPA compliant and designed to compete with US-centric tools like Loxo.1

Australia/Canada

Supported

As a cloud-native SaaS platform with English as the primary language, Spott supports these regions effectively. While local data residency centers are not explicitly confirmed for Australia, the platform’s architecture supports global usage.

Regional Notes:

The dual-structure of Spott Inc. (US) and Spott BV (Belgium) provides a unique strategic advantage. For UK and EU buyers, contracting with the Belgian entity ensures strict adherence to local data protection laws and data sovereignty, mitigating the risks associated with US-only data processing (e.g., CLOUD Act concerns). Conversely, US buyers benefit from a Delaware C-Corp structure and Silicon Valley ecosystem support.1

SECTION 3: PRICING ANALYSIS

Confidence Level: HIGH

In an industry notorious for opaque pricing and "Contact Sales" barriers, Spott differentiates itself with a transparent, per-seat SaaS model. This transparency allows for precise budget forecasting and reduces the sales cycle friction.

Currency Conversion:

Base Currency: EUR (€)

Exchange Rate Used: €1 = £0.855 GBP (approximate current mid-market rate).

All calculations are annualized to provide a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) view.

Pricing Model: Per User / Per Month (SaaS Seat Model).

Detailed Pricing Breakdown

1. Essential Plan (£810 per user/year)

Target Audience: Independent recruiters, boutique search firms (1-10 headcounts).

Core Value: Provides the full ATS/CRM backbone, including the Chrome Extension for LinkedIn sourcing. This tier effectively replaces a basic database and separate scraping tools.

Limitations: Likely includes caps on "AI Credits" (the number of automated reports or enriched profiles generated per month), pushing heavier users toward the Pro plan.3

2. Pro Plan (£1,118 per user/year)

Target Audience: Mid-market agencies (11-200 headcounts) focused on high-growth.

Core Value: Unlocks advanced automation features, likely including bulk email sequencing (replacing tools like Outreach.io or SourceWhale) and unrestricted access to the AI reporting agents.

Comparative Analysis: At roughly £93/month, Spott is priced aggressively. By comparison, a legacy stack might cost £150+ per user/month when combining an ATS (Bullhorn: ~£80), a sequencer (SourceWhale: ~£50), and a scheduler (Calendly: ~£10). Spott consolidates these costs, offering a potential 30-40% savings on the tech stack spend.3

Hidden Costs & Fees:

Setup Fee: £0 / Unknown. Unlike legacy ERP implementations that charge £5,000+ for "setup and configuration," Spott’s product-led growth (PLG) model implies self-service onboarding. However, large agencies requiring complex data migration (e.g., from a customized Bullhorn instance) should budget for potential third-party migration services or consult Spott for managed migration fees.8

Free Trial: Yes. The website prominently features a "Start for free" call to action, lowering the barrier to entry and allowing for risk-free evaluation—a rarity in the ATS market.5

Contract Terms: Monthly and Annual options are standard for this SaaS category. Annual contracts typically unlock the ~20% discount reflected in the annualized calculations (standard industry practice).

SECTION 4: COMPLIANCE & CERTIFICATIONS

Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

For HR and Talent leaders, compliance is a binary gatekeeper. Spott demonstrates a high level of maturity regarding privacy (GDPR) but is currently less proven regarding enterprise security certifications (SOC 2), a common profile for early-stage SaaS companies.

Certification/Standard

Status

Confidence

Evidence/Notes

GDPR Compliant

YES

HIGH

Explicitly stated in the Privacy Policy and Terms. The presence of a Belgian HQ ensures native adherence to EU regulations. The platform supports Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for international data transfers.4

SOC 2 Type II

Unknown

LOW

There is no public mention of SOC 2 certification on the website or trust center. Given the company's founding year (2024), it is likely in the "readiness" or "audit" phase. This is a critical gap for US enterprise buyers.9

ISO 27001

Unknown

LOW

No certificate is displayed. Similar to SOC 2, this is likely a roadmap item rather than a current credential.

Data Residency

EU/US

HIGH

The dual location structure implies data residency options are available. The terms explicitly discuss transfer mechanisms between the EEA and the US, suggesting infrastructure is in place to support sovereignty.4

CCPA Compliant

YES

MEDIUM

The US entity (San Francisco) and references to California law in the privacy policy indicate alignment with CCPA requirements for US consumers.9

Sub-Processor Transparency & AI Risk:

Spott provides a transparent list of sub-processors, which is a positive indicator of data governance maturity. Key sub-processors include:

OpenAI: Utilized for AI & Machine Learning capabilities (the "AI Agents").

Microsoft Azure: The primary cloud infrastructure provider.

Deepgram: Used for speech-to-text transcription of interviews.

Clerk: Manages user authentication and identity.9

Critical Risk Assessment:

The reliance on OpenAI for core functionality raises standard questions about data privacy. HR leaders must verify that candidate PII (Personally Identifiable Information) sent to OpenAI is not used to train OpenAI’s public models. Spott addresses this broadly by stating, "Spott does not use Google user data to develop, improve, or train generalized or non-personalized AI/ML models," implying a similar walled-garden approach for other AI sub-processors, but a specific Data Processing Agreement (DPA) should be requested to confirm this exclusion applies to OpenAI interactions.9

SECTION 5: IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

Confidence Level: MEDIUM

Spott challenges the traditional "consultant-led" implementation model of the recruitment industry with a "self-serve" product-led approach. This drastically reduces time-to-value but places more responsibility on the customer for configuration.

Estimated Timeline:

Small Teams (1-10 users): 1-3 Days. Implementation is largely plug-and-play: users sign up, authenticate their email (Google/Outlook), install the Chrome Extension, and begin sourcing.

Mid-Market (50-200 users): 2-4 Weeks. The primary critical path item is Data Migration. Moving legacy data (candidate records, notes, email history) from an existing system is complex.

Resource Requirement

Estimate

Reasoning

IT Hours

Minimal (1-5 hrs)

As a cloud-native tool, IT involvement is limited to domain authentication (DNS/DKIM setup for email deliverability) and potentially SSO configuration. There is no on-premise installation.

Admin Hours

Moderate (10-20 hrs)

Admins will need to configure recruitment pipelines, set up email templates, define user permissions, and map fields for migration. The "Quickstart Guide" supports this self-directed setup.10

Training Hours

Low

The user interface (UI) utilizes modern design patterns (resembling Notion or Linear) rather than the complex, tabular interfaces of legacy ATSs. Early reviews cite the platform as "Intuitive," suggesting minimal training overhead.3

The Migration Bottleneck:

For mid-market agencies, the biggest risk to the timeline is extracting data from the previous vendor. Legacy providers like Bullhorn often charge for data backups and may take 2-4 weeks to deliver the files.11 Spott likely provides CSV mapping tools to ingest this data once available.

Strategic Advice: Buyers should request their data backup from their current provider immediately upon signing with Spott to parallel-process the waiting period during the configuration phase.

Implementation Prerequisites:

Email Provider Access: Admin credentials for Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 are required to authorize calendar and email sync.

Legacy Data Export: A clean CSV or JSON export of candidates, companies, and contacts from the previous ATS.

LinkedIn Recruiter: While not strictly required, having active LinkedIn Recruiter licenses maximizes the value of Spott’s sourcing extension.

SECTION 6: INTEGRATIONS & ECOSYSTEM

Confidence Level: HIGH

Spott’s integration strategy is a major departure from the "Marketplace" model of competitors. Instead of relying on a vast ecosystem of third-party apps, Spott aims to be an "All-In-One" platform, building core functionalities natively.

Strategic Implication: This reduces "subscription bloat" (paying for 5 different tools) but means the platform is less flexible if you prefer a specific niche tool (e.g., if you absolutely love a specific video interview platform that Spott doesn't integrate with).

Top Platform Integrations

Platform

Type

Quality

Evidence/Notes

LinkedIn

Native (Chrome Ext)

HIGH

Bi-directional sync allows recruiters to import candidates directly from LinkedIn profiles and Recruiter search results. It also logs LinkedIn messages sent/received, creating a unified communication log.5

Microsoft Outlook

Native

HIGH

Deep integration for email syncing and calendar management. Essential for the agency workflow where Outlook is the primary communication hub.12

Google Workspace

Native

HIGH

Full sync for Gmail and Google Calendar. Supports "Sign in with Google" for streamlined authentication.13

WhatsApp

Native

HIGH

A key differentiator for European and Asian markets. Recruiters can chat with candidates via WhatsApp directly from the Spott dashboard, capturing these "invisible" conversations.14

VoIP (Aircall)

Integration

MEDIUM

"Aircall" is listed as a supported telephony integration, allowing for click-to-dial and call logging functionality.10

Zapier

Middleware

Likely

While specific documentation was not retrieved in snippets, Zapier is a standard connectivity layer for modern SaaS to handle edge-case integrations.

Missing Integrations (Gap Analysis):

HRIS (Workday/BambooHR): NOT SUPPORTED. This absence reinforces Spott’s market positioning. Recruitment agencies do not need to push hired candidates into an internal payroll system like Workday; their workflow ends at "Placement" and "Invoicing." The lack of these integrations makes Spott unsuitable for internal HR teams who require seamless data flow from "Hire" to "Onboarding".2

Assessment Tools: There is no mention of native integrations with coding test platforms (e.g., HackerRank) or psychometric testing tools. Agencies utilizing these would likely need to run them as separate, disconnected workflows.

API Access:

Spott provides a Public API and a Protected API, empowering mid-market agencies with internal engineering resources to build custom dashboards or connect proprietary data sources. This extensibility is crucial for larger agencies that treat their data as a competitive asset.10

SECTION 7: CASE STUDY & SOCIAL PROOF

Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH

Spott builds trust through strong social proof, leveraging its Y Combinator backing and early success stories in the European consultancy market to validate its "AI-native" claims.

Primary Case Study: Pauwels Consulting

Company: Pauwels Consulting

Company Size: Mid-market (Estimated 200+ employees based on its status as a major consultancy in Belgium).

Industry: Life Sciences, Engineering, and IT Staffing.

Challenge: The firm faced significant inefficiencies with manual sourcing, spending hours constructing complex Boolean search strings and manually compiling candidate reports.

Solution: Implemented Spott to leverage Natural Language Search and Automated Reporting.

Results:

"Finding matches in minutes" – A drastic reduction from hours of manual searching.

"It's like having a researcher working 24/7" – Qualitative validation of the AI agent’s capability to augment human effort.

Operational Impact: The automation of low-value tasks (searching, report writing) freed up recruiters to focus on high-value candidate interactions.

Secondary Evidence & Notable Customers

Serena Advisory: A customer testimonial highlights the "Meeting Co-Pilot" feature: "Automated interview summaries are changing how we work. I can focus on having meaningful conversations... instead of on the notes." This validates the utility of the transcription and auto-fill features.5

HROne Group: Listed as a customer, further cementing Spott’s traction within the staffing vertical.

Aggregate Marketing Metrics:

2x more time spent on the phone (due to admin reduction).

70% reduction in administrative time.

1.5x increase in placements per month.

5

Note on Case Study Confidence: While the qualitative testimonials from recognizable firms like Pauwels Consulting are verified, the specific quantitative metrics (e.g., "70% reduction") are presented as aggregate marketing claims rather than audited study results. However, the logic holds: automating report writing and note-taking inherently reduces administrative load.

SECTION 8: CONTENT & MEDIA

Confidence Level: MEDIUM

Key Features (Differentiation)

The following features represent the "AI-Native" capabilities that distinguish Spott from legacy ATS platforms:

AI Spec CV Generator: This is the platform's "killer feature" for agencies. It ingests a candidate's raw CV and interview notes to generate a polished, branded "Spec CV" or "Candidate Packet" for client submission. This automates a process that typically takes 30-60 minutes per candidate.1

Natural Language Database Search: Replaces complex Boolean logic (e.g., (Java OR Python) AND (London OR Remote) NOT Junior) with conversational queries (e.g., "Find me mid-level developers in London"). This lowers the barrier to entry for junior recruiters.6

Meeting Co-Pilot & Auto-Fill: The AI agent joins video calls (Zoom/Teams), transcribes the discussion, and intelligently updates CRM fields. For example, if a candidate mentions "I need £60k," the AI updates the "Salary Expectation" field automatically.7

Unified Outreach Sequences: Users can build multi-channel drip campaigns that span Email, LinkedIn InMails, and WhatsApp messages within a single workflow, automating candidate nurture.5

Browser-Based Sourcing: A Chrome Extension overlays LinkedIn, allowing recruiters to add candidates to the database or sequences without switching tabs, streamlining the sourcing workflow.15

Media Assets

Product Aesthetics: Screenshots reveal a modern, minimalist interface utilizing whitespace and card-based layouts, similar to productivity tools like Linear or Notion. This contrasts sharply with the spreadsheet-heavy, data-dense interfaces of Bullhorn or Vincere.

Demo Access: The primary call-to-action is "Book a Demo," but the "Start for Free" option suggests a low-friction entry point for evaluation.5

SECTION 9: REVIEWS & RATINGS

Confidence Level: HIGH (Volume: Low)

As a company founded in 2024, Spott has a limited volume of public reviews. However, the available feedback is highly specific and validates the core value proposition.

Review Context:

The lack of review volume is a direct reflection of the company's stage (Seed/Early Growth). The G2 review confirms that the product is live, functional, and delivering value to paying customers. The backing of Y Combinator serves as a proxy for credibility in the absence of hundreds of reviews, signaling that the company has undergone rigorous vetting by top-tier investors.

SECTION 10: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Confidence Level: HIGH

Spott operates in the Agency ATS market, a distinct vertical from corporate HR software. Its competition is defined by "Legacy Incumbents" and "Modern Challengers."

Primary Competitors

1. Bullhorn (The Legacy Incumbent)

Market Position: The dominant player in the agency space, used by the majority of large staffing firms.

Differentiation:

Bullhorn: Offers enterprise-grade stability and infinite customizability but suffers from a dated UI, slow performance, and a reliance on a paid marketplace for modern features (automation, chat, AI). Implementation is heavy and expensive.

Spott: Wins on User Experience (UX), Speed, and Price. It bundles the "Marketplace" features (sequencing, AI) into the core platform. However, Spott cannot yet match Bullhorn's depth of configuration for complex, multi-national enterprise workflows.

2. Loxo (The Modern Challenger)

Market Position: A rapidly growing "All-in-One" platform popular with SME agencies in the US.

Differentiation:

Loxo: Its primary moat is its proprietary database of 1.2 billion profiles (Loxo Source), positioning it as a data provider + ATS.

Spott: Differentiates through Workflow Automation. While Loxo provides the data, Spott focuses on doing the work (writing reports, updating fields). Spott's "AI Agent" approach is more focused on replacing administrative tasks than just providing contact info.

3. Vincere (The Staffing Specialist)

Market Position: Strong in the Temp/Contract staffing market.

Differentiation:

Vincere: excels at the complex back-office mechanics of temporary staffing (timesheets, pay-and-bill, margin calculators).

Spott: Is currently better suited for Permanent Placement and Executive Search where the quality of the candidate presentation (the Spec CV) and relationship management is paramount.

FINAL ASSESSMENT

OVERALL DATA QUALITY: B+

Strengths: The research provides high-confidence data on Pricing, Core Features, Target Market Fit, and Privacy Compliance (GDPR). The "AI-Native" value proposition is clearly defined and differentiated.

Weaknesses: As an early-stage company, there is a lack of verified Enterprise Security Certifications (SOC 2 Type II) and a low volume of third-party user reviews. Long-term reliability is inferred from investor backing rather than a decade of track record.

CONFIDENCE BY SECTION:

Basic Info: HIGH

Company Size: HIGH

Pricing: HIGH (Transparent, public pricing available)

Compliance: MEDIUM-HIGH (GDPR verified; SOC 2 unverified)

Implementation: MEDIUM (Estimates based on PLG norms)

Integrations: HIGH (Clear documentation of native vs. API capabilities)

Case Study: MEDIUM (Validated logos, but ROI metrics are marketing-sourced)

RESEARCHER'S NOTE & RECOMMENDATION:

Spott is a high-potential "Buy" for Mid-Market Recruitment Agencies (50-200 users), particularly those focused on Permanent Placement and Executive Search. The platform offers a compelling ROI by consolidating a fragmented tech stack into a single, modern interface, potentially saving £30-£50 per user/month in software costs while significantly reducing administrative overhead via AI agents.

Critical Caveat for Corporate HR:

DO NOT BUY if you are an internal Talent Acquisition team. Spott lacks the fundamental integrations (HRIS) and governance workflows required for corporate hiring. It is an aggressive sales tool for headhunters, not a compliance tool for HR.

FIELDS NEEDING VENDOR FOLLOW-UP:

SOC 2 Type II Status: Is the audit currently in progress, and what is the estimated completion date?

Data Migration Services: Does Spott offer a managed "White Glove" migration service for extracting data from legacy Bullhorn instances?

AI Data Privacy: Can Spott provide a specific Data Processing Agreement (DPA) confirming that client data sent to OpenAI is strictly excluded from public model training?

RESEARCH NOTES

Currency: All financial figures have been converted to GBP using a conservative exchange rate (£1 = €1.17 approx).

Market Context: The recruitment agency software market is currently undergoing a "platform shift." Agencies are moving away from heavy, server-based legacy systems toward lightweight, browser-based AI tools. Spott is at the forefront of this wave.

Terminology: In this report, "Agency" refers to external recruitment firms (Headhunters), while "In-House" refers to internal HR departments. Spott is exclusively for the former.
