Short Description:

AI-powered conversational recruiting and interview automation for high-volume hiring. 1

Long Description:

Humanly.io represents a significant evolution in the landscape of Talent Acquisition (TA) technology, positioning itself not merely as a tool for automation but as a comprehensive AI-driven recruiting platform and Talent CRM designed to fundamentally restructure how organizations handle high-volume hiring.1 In an industry often plagued by disjointed point solutions, Humanly has engineered a unified ecosystem that bridges the critical gap between initial candidate interest and the final hiring decision. Unlike traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which often function primarily as static repositories of data—systems of record rather than systems of engagement—Humanly operates as an intelligent, active engagement layer that sits atop existing HR technology stacks.8 Its architectural philosophy is built around the concept of "AI that Elevates," focusing on amplifying human potential rather than replacing it, a distinction that is increasingly critical in a market sensitive to the ethical implications of automation.9

The platform’s core functionality addresses the most resource-intensive segment of the recruitment funnel: the top-of-funnel activities comprising candidate screening, scheduling, and initial interviewing.6 At the heart of this capability is a sophisticated Conversational AI—frequently described by users and the vendor as an "AI Recruiter"—that engages candidates instantly across multiple channels, including web chat, SMS, and email.6 This is a departure from first-generation scripted chatbots that relied on rigid decision trees; Humanly’s technology utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to conduct "two-way conversations." This capability allows the system to analyze candidate intent, sentiment, and specific qualifications in real-time.10 By doing so, Humanly effectively screens candidates against specific, customizable job requirements 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ensuring that no applicant enters the proverbial "black hole" of recruitment—a major pain point for candidate experience in high-volume industries.1

A key differentiator for Humanly is its strategic expansion beyond simple text-based interaction into the realm of structured digital interviews and autonomous scoring.11 While market competitors like Paradox have historically focused heavily on enterprise-wide chat automation and logistics, Humanly has carved out a niche by emphasizing the quality and fairness of the interview itself. The platform’s "AI Interviewer" capability can conduct initial screening interviews autonomously, generating structured scorecards and insights. This methodology is designed to reduce unconscious bias by standardizing the evaluation criteria for every candidate, ensuring that hiring decisions are based on data and competency rather than subjective "gut feeling".12 This focus on validity and fairness is underpinned by rigorous third-party audits (such as those by FairNow), positioning Humanly as a leader in ethical AI compliance—a critical factor for mid-market and enterprise companies navigating new regulations like NYC’s Local Law 144.11

Furthermore, the platform's utility extends into the post-application phase through its Talent CRM. This component is essential for modern recruitment strategies that prioritize "rediscovery"—the ability to mine an organization's existing database for silver-medalist candidates who match new job openings.7 By automating the re-engagement of these pre-qualified candidates, Humanly helps organizations significantly reduce their reliance on paid job board advertising, driving down the overall Cost Per Hire (CPH). The May 2024 acquisition of Teamable further bolstered this capability, integrating deep employee referral and social sourcing functionalities directly into the platform, thereby transforming Humanly from a screening tool into a full-cycle sourcing and engagement powerhouse.15

Target Users:

The ideal buyer persona for Humanly encompasses Heads of Talent Acquisition, VPs of People, and Recruiting Operations leaders within mid-market to enterprise-level organizations (typically ranging from 50 to 5,000+ employees).7 The platform is particularly engineered for industries characterized by high-volume hiring needs, such as retail, healthcare, hospitality, logistics, and professional services.14 In these sectors, the speed of response often dictates hiring success; Humanly’s ability to engage candidates within seconds of application addresses the high drop-off rates common in these competitive labor markets.

Main Use Cases:

High-Volume Screening: The platform automates the qualification of thousands of applicants for hourly or entry-level roles. By deploying chat-based screening directly on career sites and via SMS, Humanly removes the administrative bottleneck of manual resume review.16

Interview Scheduling: Humanly eliminates the friction of calendar coordination. Qualified candidates are empowered to self-schedule interviews directly into recruiter calendars, synchronizing in real-time with Google, Outlook, and other major calendar systems.1

Reference Checking: The system automates the collection of reference feedback, a traditionally slow process, thereby accelerating the final stages of the hiring cycle and enabling faster offer generation.11

Re-engagement/Rediscovery: The platform mines the existing ATS for past candidates who match new job openings and automatically triggers personalized outreach campaigns, turning a static database into an active talent pool.14

Technology Approach:

Humanly employs a proprietary mix of predictive analytics and conversational AI. Crucially, the platform integrates deeply with major ATS platforms (including Greenhouse, Workday, Lever, and iCIMS) via API to ensure data hygiene and bidirectional synchronization.6 This ensures that Humanly acts as a seamless extension of the existing tech stack rather than a siloed application. It leverages machine learning to improve candidate matching accuracy over time and provides "audit-ready" fairness analytics to ensure compliance with emerging AI hiring laws, reflecting a "compliance-first" engineering culture.11

Confidence Level: HIGH

SECTION 2: COMPANY SIZE & REGIONAL FIT

Time: 5 minutes | Confidence Target: HIGH

Ideal Company Sizes:

[x] 1-50 employees

[x] 51-200 employees

[x] 201-500 employees

[x] 500+ employees

Evidence:

1-50: While not the primary target for their enterprise sales motion, reviews indicate active usage by small businesses. "Small-Business (50 or fewer emp.)" users have explicitly left reviews on G2, indicating that the platform's utility scales down to smaller, agile teams needing automation.19

51-200: "Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)" is a dominant category in G2 reviews.19 The tool is frequently positioned as a "mid-market friendly" alternative to enterprise heavyweights like Paradox, offering similar capabilities with lower implementation overhead.20

201-500: Case studies feature companies like TheKey (thousands of caregivers) and Moss Adams (a significant mid-market/enterprise accounting firm), indicating a strong fit for this segment where manual processes begin to break down under volume.21

500+: Humanly explicitly targets "mid-market and enterprise teams" in its marketing collateral and lists large-scale customers like Microsoft, Worldwide Flight Services, and Moss Adams.10 The scalability of the "Stream Slot" pricing model supports organizations with hundreds of concurrent open roles.

Company Size Notes:

Analysis of marketing materials, pricing structures, and third-party reviews suggests the sweet spot is the Mid-Market (200-1,000 employees). While clearly capable of serving enterprise clients (e.g., Microsoft, Noom), Humanly is frequently cited as a more accessible, agile alternative to Paradox for mid-sized organizations. These companies often require "enterprise-grade" features—such as deep ATS integration and SOC 2 compliance—but wish to avoid the extreme complexity, long implementation times, and rigid cost structures associated with legacy enterprise contracts.11 The pricing structure, which is based on "stream slots" (active roles) rather than total employee headcount, is particularly advantageous for companies with consistent high-volume hiring needs in specific departments (e.g., customer support, sales) rather than just massive global headcount.26

Supported Regions:

[x] UK

[x] US

[x] EU

[x] Australia

[x] Canada

[x] Global

Evidence:

US: The company is headquartered in Seattle, WA 27, making the US its primary market and operational hub.

UK: "Humanly Limited" is listed as a legal entity in the UK (status listed as 'Deadpooled' in one source, but operations are global via the US entity and serve UK markets).2 Case studies and data residency discussions regarding GDPR imply active capability in this region.

EU: There are explicit mentions of GDPR compliance and data processing frameworks for EEA residents in their privacy policy, indicating active support for European clients.28

Global: Third-party comparison sites state "Works across all devices... used by customers in more than 50 countries" (Note: This quote was found in a comparison snippet; however, Humanly's own text mentions "Global availability" for candidates engaging via chat 24/7).29 The conversational AI supports "hundreds of languages," facilitating global deployment.14

Regional Notes:

Humanly is primarily US-focused in terms of its commercial headquarters but is fully architected for international deployment.

GDPR & Data Privacy: The privacy policy explicitly addresses rights for residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and compliance with GDPR, utilizing standard contractual clauses or similar mechanisms for data transfer.28

Language Support: The platform supports "hundreds of languages" for candidate-facing conversations. This is a critical feature for global companies or those in multilingual regions (e.g., Canada, parts of the US), ensuring inclusive engagement across distributed teams.14

Data Residency: While GDPR compliance is stated, specific "data residency" options (e.g., guaranteeing data stays physically located in Australia or the UK) are not explicitly detailed in the public documentation, though the platform is hosted on Microsoft Azure, which theoretically supports regional hosting capabilities.3 Buyers in Australia or the UK with strict data sovereignty requirements should verify specific server location options during the sales process.

Confidence Level: HIGH

SECTION 3: PRICING

Time: 15 minutes | Confidence Target: HIGH

Pricing Annual Min (GBP): £9,449 (Estimated)

Pricing Annual Max (GBP): Custom (Enterprise implementations can exceed £100k+)

How Calculated:

Min: Sources indicate a pricing model based on "Stream slots" (active roles). One specific source explicitly cites $12,000 per year per Stream slot.26

Calculation: $12,000 USD / 1.27 (Exchange Rate) = £9,448.81 (rounded to £9,449).

Alternative "starting" price mentioned in some reviews is $1,000/month.26 $1,000 * 12 = $12,000 USD = £9,449 GBP.

Max: Enterprise pricing is custom and scales with volume. For a company requiring 10 active high-volume roles simultaneously, the cost would scale linearly or with volume discounts: 10 slots * £9,449 = £94,490.

Pricing Currency: USD (Original)

Pricing Model: Flat Rate / Per Active Role (Stream Slot)

Definition: Humanly utilizes a unique "Stream Slot" pricing model rather than a traditional "per employee" or "per recruiter" seat model. A "Stream Slot" supports sourcing and screening for one role at a time. The specific job requisition in the slot can be changed as needed (e.g., once a role is filled, the slot can be reassigned to a new role), but the concurrency is limited by the number of slots purchased.26

Per User: Some sources mention platform access includes "up to two users" per slot 26, but the primary cost driver is the slot, not the seat count. This encourages efficient closure of roles to free up slots.

Pricing Notes:

Entry Level: The entry point appears to be ~$12,000 USD/year (£9,449). This package typically includes one "Stream" (one active high-volume role sourcing/screening pipeline) and typically access for ~2 users.26

Scaling: Costs scale based on the number of concurrent job openings ("Streams") a company needs to automate simultaneously. This aligns the cost with hiring velocity and volume rather than just company size.

Inclusions: The base price generally includes AI sourcing, automated campaigns, CRM features, and ATS integration.26

Transparency: Humanly does not publish public pricing on its main website; it utilizes a "Quote-based" sales motion, which is standard for mid-market/enterprise HR tech.6

ROI Claim: Marketing materials claim one stream slot ($12k) can save equivalent to "$240,000 in placement fees" by reducing reliance on external agencies and job boards.30

Setup Fee (GBP): Unknown / Likely Custom.

Analysis: One competitor comparison mentions "Custom" pricing without explicit setup fees.26 In enterprise software, setup fees are often included in the annual contract value (ACV) or waived for multi-year agreements.Setup Fee Included in contract? Likely Yes (for annual deals).Free Trial Available? No.32Free Trial Duration (days): N/A

Contract Length Options:

[x] Annual (Standard) 26

[x] Multi-Year (Implied for Enterprise)

Evidence:

"Humanly costs $1,000 per month or $12,000 annually per Stream slot...".26

"One Stream slot costs $12,000 per year...".30

Confidence Level: HIGH (Specific pricing numbers found in multiple third-party buyer guides and cached documents).

SECTION 4: COMPLIANCE & CERTIFICATIONS

Time: 10 minutes | Confidence Target: HIGH

GDPR Compliant: Yes

Evidence: The Privacy Policy is explicit: "GDPR Compliance... If you are a resident of the European Economic Area... you have certain data protection rights.".28 The Terms also state: "Compliant with EU General Data Protection Regulations.".3

EEOC Compliant: Yes

Evidence: Humanly aligns its algorithmic auditing with EEOC guidelines for adverse impact analysis and bias mitigation. The company states: "Documented bias mitigation... align with EEOC guidelines.".11 This is critical for US-based hiring to avoid discrimination lawsuits.

SOC 2 Type II Certified: Yes

Evidence: Multiple sources confirm this status. "SOC 1 and SOC 2 A18:C26" is listed in partner compliance docs.33 Reviewers and employment platforms also cite "With ISO 27001... as well as SOC 2 Type II compliance...".34 Reviews mention "SOC 2 Type II Compliant" badges visible on the platform.35

HIPAA Compliant: Unknown / Not Intended

Evidence: The Privacy Policy explicitly states the service is "not intended for use with protected health information under HIPAA".28 While Humanly serves healthcare clients (e.g., Noom Healthcare, Moss Adams, TheKey), the tool handles recruitment data (employment history, skills), not patient data (PHI). Therefore, while the security controls (encryption, access control) might meet HIPAA technical standards, they likely do not sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) for recruitment data processing.

ISO 27001 Certified: Yes

Evidence: The Terms and Conditions page explicitly lists "Logo of ISO 27001 Certification" and states "ISO 27001... Compliant".3 This international standard validates their information security management system (ISMS).

Compliance Documentation URL:

Privacy Policy 28

(https://www.humanly.io/legal/terms-and-conditions) 3

Compliance Notes:

Humanly has established a robust security posture suitable for enterprise deployment, particularly for a company of its size.

Certifications: Possesses SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications, which are the gold standards for SaaS security.3

Data Security: Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using standard protocols (SSL/TLS). The platform is hosted on Microsoft Azure, inheriting Azure's world-class physical security controls.3

AI Ethics & Bias: This is a major selling point. Humanly publishes an "Ethical AI Framework" and undergoes third-party bias audits (e.g., by FairNow) to ensure algorithms do not discriminate based on protected characteristics. This aligns with emerging regulations like NYC Local Law 144 and EEOC standards.11

Privacy: Fully GDPR and CCPA compliant, with specific data rights mechanisms in place for candidates.28

Confidence Level: HIGH (Direct quotes from legal documents and trust badges).

SECTION 5: IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

Time: 10 minutes | Confidence Target: MEDIUM-HIGH

Implementation Timeline Min (weeks): 2 weeks

Implementation Timeline Max (weeks): 4 weeks

Evidence:

Case Study (TheKey): Explicitly states that "Humanly could be easily implemented into TheKey's Applicant Tracking System (ATS) of choice within a matter of weeks.".22

Case Study (Noom): "Onboarding to Humanly's platform took less than 24 hours" for the initial setup to hit the ground running.36 This suggests that for certain use cases (e.g., sourcing only), deployment can be almost immediate.

Competitor Comparison: "G2 reviews highlight faster implementation (2-4 weeks vs 4-8 weeks)" when comparing Humanly against legacy competitors.37

Reviews: Users consistently commend "implementation ease" and "intuitive setup".19

IT Hours Required: Minimal. The integrations are largely API-driven or via OAuth, requiring simple credential exchanges rather than complex code deployment.

HR Admin Hours Required: Moderate (Initial setup of screening questions and workflows).

Training Hours - Admin: Minimal (Platform is described as "Easiest to Do Business With" on G2).38

Implementation Prerequisites:

ATS Access: The client must have API credentials or admin access for their ATS (e.g., Greenhouse Harvest API key, Workday ISU credentials) to enable the bi-directional sync.39

Job Architecture: The buying organization needs defined job descriptions and screening questions (knockout questions) ready to program into the conversational AI.

Calendar Integration: Recruiters need to sync their Google or Outlook calendars to enable the automated scheduling feature.6

Common Implementation Delays:

Custom Integrations: While standard integrations (Greenhouse, Lever) are fast, enterprise legacy systems (e.g., older Taleo versions or highly customized Workday configurations) can introduce complexity and delays.

Internal Alignment: Delays often stem from the buying organization defining what the chatbot should say/ask (voice and tone calibration), rather than the technical setup itself.

Security Review: For enterprise clients, the internal security review of Humanly's SOC 2/ISO docs can take longer than the actual software setup.

Confidence Level: HIGH (Supported by multiple case studies and user reviews).

SECTION 9: REVIEWS & RATINGS

Time: 5 minutes | Confidence Target: HIGH

G2 Rating: 4.8 / 5.0

G2 Review Count: 115+

G2 URL: https://www.g2.com/products/humanly/reviews 7

G2 Notes:

Praise: Humanly has received "Best Support" and "Easiest to Do Business With" badges (Winter 2025). Users frequently cite massive time savings (e.g., "reclaimed approximately 30-50 hours per open position") and the seamless nature of the ATS integration.7 The candidate experience (4.8/5 satisfaction) is also a frequent highlight.

Complaints: Some users mention minor bugs in formatting or a desire for more advanced custom permissions. Others have noted that deeper analytics in the base tier could be improved.19

Capterra Rating: 4.8 / 5.0 (Based on aggregated data, fewer reviews than G2).51

TrustRadius: Listed, with scores consistent with G2 (~8-9/10 range), but G2 remains the primary source of volume reviews.52

SECTION 10: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Time: 5 minutes | Confidence Target: MEDIUM

Primary Competitors:

Paradox (Olivia): The 800lb gorilla in conversational AI. Paradox is more enterprise-focused (Fortune 500) and generally more expensive. Humanly positions itself as the more agile, mid-market friendly alternative that offers better "voice" and interview analysis features, whereas Paradox is heavily focused on chat automation and logistics.11

Sense: Strong in the staffing and recruiting agency world. While Humanly competes here, it leans more towards corporate HR teams (in-house TA), whereas Sense has deep roots in staffing agency workflows (Bullhorn integration).53

Grayscale: Focuses heavily on SMS/Texting automation for high-volume hiring. Humanly differentiates by offering broader "interview intelligence" features (Voice/Video analysis) and a more comprehensive CRM, whereas Grayscale is often a pure-play texting/automation layer.11

Competitive Differentiation:

"AI that Elevates" (Ethics Focus): Humanly markets its ethical/bias-reduction focus more aggressively than most competitors. They utilize third-party audits (e.g., by FairNow) to prove compliance with new AI laws, rather than just claiming it. This "compliance-first" approach appeals to risk-averse mid-market companies.13

Interview Intelligence: Unlike Paradox, which is primarily chat-based, Humanly includes Humanly Voice, a tool to analyze live human-to-human interviews for bias and efficiency. This bridges the gap between automation (chat) and human connection (interview), offering value deeper into the funnel than just screening.44

Mid-Market Agility: Implementation takes weeks for Humanly versus potentially months for legacy Enterprise tools. This speed-to-value is a critical differentiator for the 50-500 employee segment that lacks massive IT resources.37

Unified Sourcing: The acquisition of Teamable gives Humanly a native "Rediscovery" and "Referral" engine that many competitors only offer via partnership or inferior built-in tools.15

Confidence Level: HIGH

FINAL ASSESSMENT

OVERALL DATA QUALITY: A

Reasoning: The research yielded high-confidence data for critical decision-making fields: the unique "Stream Slot" pricing structure is well-documented in third-party sources, specific compliance certifications (SOC2, ISO) are verified in legal docs, and named native integrations are confirmed via partner directories. The case studies provided quantified metrics (ROI, time savings) from recognizable brands.

CONFIDENCE BY SECTION:

Basic Info: HIGH. Verified via official site, legal footers, and acquisition news.

Company Size: HIGH. Validated via case studies (Noom, TheKey) and G2 reviewer demographics.

Pricing: HIGH. Specific numbers ($12k/slot) found, offering a clear baseline despite the official page being "contact sales."

Compliance: HIGH. Privacy policy and terms explicitly list certifications and GDPR adherence.

Implementation: MEDIUM-HIGH. "Weeks" is a consistent timeline, though specific "IT Hours" are estimated based on standard API integration norms.

Integrations: HIGH. Partner directories (Greenhouse, Workday) confirm status and quality.

Case Study: HIGH. TheKey and Noom studies offer hard, verifiable metrics.

FIELDS NEEDING VENDOR FOLLOW-UP:

Australian Data Residency: While GDPR covers EU/UK, explicit confirmation of Australian data servers (if required by an AU client for sovereignty) is missing from public docs.

Exact Setup Fee: Not explicitly found; likely bundled or custom based on complexity. Clarification on whether this is waived for multi-year deals would be beneficial.

RESEARCH NOTES:

Humanly.io has emerged as a formidable "challenger" brand to Paradox, offering a modern, mid-market friendly approach to high-volume hiring. Their acquisition of Teamable (May 2024) is a strategic pivot that significantly boosts their sourcing capabilities, transforming them from a "chatbot point solution" into a "full-cycle recruiting platform." Buyers should be particularly attentive to the pricing model: paying per "Stream Slot" (active role) rather than per seat is a distinct advantage for efficiency-minded teams, but it requires a clear understanding of your organization's concurrent hiring volume to forecast costs accurately. The platform's heavy emphasis on Ethical AI and Bias Auditing makes it a strong contender for organizations in regulated industries or those with strict DEI mandates.
