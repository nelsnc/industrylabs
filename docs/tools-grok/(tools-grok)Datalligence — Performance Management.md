Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered OKR software for goal

alignment and performance tracking.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Datalligence Al is a cloud-based platform specializing in Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

management and continuous performance enablement. Founded in 2020, it combines

strategic goal-setting with real-time tracking to bridge the gap between organizational

strategy and individual execution. The platform's core functionality revolves around its OKR

Engine, which supports multi-directional alignment: top-down cascading for executive

intent, bottom-up innovation for employee contributions, and cross-functional linking to

map dependencies across teams. This is augmented by a Confidence Index that adds

predictive analytics to goal attainment, allowing managers to intervene early on potential

risks.


The Performance Management Engine shifts from annual reviews to ongoing feedback

loops, including weekly check-ins, automated nudges via integrations like Slack or

Microsoft Teams, and a 9-Box Talent Matrix for succession planning. This matrix

synthesizes performance data and potential assessments to identify high-potentials and

underperformers objectively. Task management integrates directly with Key Results,

ensuring daily activities align with strategic outcomes and preventing unproductive work.
Key differentiators include its practitioner-led design, drawing from founders’ experience

in methodologies like Hoshin Kanri and Balanced Scorecard, and a hybrid SaaS-plus-

coaching model. Unlike competitors focused on data entry, Datalligence emphasizes

behavioral change through OKR consulting and certification services. It targets mid-market

organizations seeking affordable, user-friendly alternatives to enterprise tools, with

aggressive pricing starting at $4/user/month. Usability is highlighted in reviews, with a

"headless" experience via communication integrations reducing software fatigue.


Ideal buyers are HR leaders and managers in growing companies (51-500 employees)

needing agile alignment in hybrid/remote environments. Main use cases include: (1)

Strategic alignment in scaling startups, (2) Continuous performance in healthcare/retail for

operational efficiency, (3) Cross-team collaboration in tech firms via dependency mapping.

The Al/ML approach is evident in features like Al-assisted OKR writing (though not core),

predictive confidence scoring, and automated progress nudges. Security features support

GDPR compliance, with encryption and role-based access. Overall, Datalligence

democratizes Silicon Valley-style management for smaller firms, focusing on cultural

transformation over mere tracking. (412 words)
