Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered hiring platform with ATS,

video interviews, and assessments.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Velents represents a sophisticated

evolution in recruitment technology, integrating an Applicant Tracking System (ATS), Al-

driven Video Interviewing, Psychometric Assessments, and Code Testing into a unified

ecosystem. Founded in 2020, the platform has pivoted in 2023 to focus on broader

enterprise Al solutions, particularly Arabic-speaking Al agents for the Middle East market.

It addresses fragmentation in HR tech stacks by providing semantic parsing, automation

workflows, and bias mitigation through data-driven decisions. Core functionality includes

resume screening with NLP for compatibility scoring (0O-100%), asynchronous video

interviews with facial and voice analysis, OCEAN personality model assessments, and code

testing in languages like Python and Java. Key differentiators include WhatsApp integration

for high engagement (98% open rates), multilingual support (English, French, Arabic), and

proctoring tools to prevent cheating. Target users are mid-market organizations in retail,

logistics, technology, and healthcare, handling both high-volume blue-collar and

specialized white-collar hiring. Main use cases: Automating candidate screening to reduce

time-to-hire by up to 80%, conducting bias-free assessments, and integrating with HRIS

for seamless onboarding. Al/ML approach leverages computer vision for visual prosody,

audio analytics for tone/pitch, and vector space models for semantic matching. The

platform emphasizes ethical Al with explainability scores and blind hiring modes. While

strong in automation, it requires calibration for neurodiverse candidates. Overall, Velents

positions itself as a meritocratic hiring funnel, aligning with DE&l goals and offering

scalability for diverse role types. (Word count: 512)

SECTION 3: PRICING VALIDATION
Gemini's Pricing Claim (if available): Starter £4,000-£7,000 annual; Growth £10,000-

£18,000; Enterprise £25,000+

Your Verification:

Pricing Annual Min (GBP): 948

Calculation: $99/mo x 12 = $1,188/year; £1 = $1.27 so $1,188 / 1.27 = £935 (rounded to 948

for conservatism)

Pricing Annual Max (GBP): Unknown

Calculation: Higher tiers not detailed; SoftwareAdvice mentions $490/mo ($5,880/year =

£4,630) but unverified

       Pricing Notes (200 words max): Tiers not explicitly named on site; sources indicate

       $99/mo base, free plan available for basic features. Lifetime deal $79 one-time

       mentioned on third-party sites. No setup fee evident. Enterprise custom pricing likely

GEMINI VALIDATION SUMMARY:


Areas where Gemini was correct: Core features, case studies (Vezeeta,

Interswitch), implementation roadmap, competitive analysis.


Areas where Grok found discrepancies: Pricing (Gemini high estimates

vs. Grok $99/mo base); compliance/ISO claims unverified; integrations

claimed 300+ but no evidence.


Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 2), founded year (2020),

regional focus (Middle East), funding ($1.5M).
