   -“’   Performance Management


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-native platform for performance

enablement with continuous feedback and coaching.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Mesh Al is an Al-native performance management platform designed to shift organizations

from traditional retrospective performance management to prospective performance

enablement. It integrates generative Al through its proprietary engine, Maven, which acts

as a pervasive intelligence layer for coaching, nudging, and insights. The platform sits atop

existing HRIS systems, integrating with over 200 tools like Workday, BambooHR, and SAP

SuccessFactors, to provide a social-first interface for goal setting (OKRs), continuous

feedback, 1:1 meetings, and performance reviews.


Core functionality includes dynamic goal management with cascading alignment, Al-

assisted goal crafting, and automated progress tracking. The continuous feedback loop

features a social recognition wall, real-time feedback requests, and distinction between

public praise and private advice. Performance reviews aggregate data to eliminate recency

bias, with calibration tools for bias detection and configurable cycles. 1:1 meetings support

collaborative agendas, action item tracking, and Al transcription. Career development plans

map competencies and suggest actionable growth steps.

Key differentiators: Unlike legacy systems focused on compliance and documentation,

Mesh emphasizes behavioral change through Nudge Theory and social physics, fostering

transparency and habit formation. Maven transcends chatbots by providing proactive

nudges, just-in-time coaching, and engagement alerts to identify talent risks. It's tailored

for mid-market to enterprise organizations (100-2000 employees), with a focus on remote

and distributed teams.

Target users: HR leaders, people managers, and employees in tech-forward companies

seeking to increase high-performer density. Ideal for scaling teams where traditional HR

tools feel outdated.

Main use cases:
   - Aligning individual goals to organizational strategy for better execution.


   - Building a culture of continuous feedback to reduce review anxiety and improve

        retention.


   - Democratizing coaching for managers via Al to enhance leadership development.


   - Predicting and mitigating attrition through sentiment analysis and insights.


   - Streamlining reviews with data aggregation and bias checks for fair evaluations.


Al/ML approach: Maven leverages large language models for natural language querying,

writing assistance, and personalized recommendations. It analyzes performance data

longitudinally to generate prescriptive insights, nudges, and coaching content, ensuring

ethical Al use with bias-free outputs.


The platform's modular tiers (Foundations, Growth, Excellence) allow phased adoption,

starting from basic goals and reviews to full Al coaching and development plans. Security is

enterprise-grade with SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance. Client outcomes

include 50x increase in conversations (CleverTap), 60% time reduction in reviews (Dana),

and improved transparency (Pipefy). Mesh positions itself as a "system of engagement"

bridging strategy and execution, competing with Lattice and Culture Amp but at lower

costs with stronger Al nativity. (612 words)


Key Features (5-8 bullet points - CSV-ready):

   1.    Al-powered goal setting and OKR alignment with cascading visualization.


   2. Continuous feedback via praise, advice, and real-time requests.

         Performance reviews with context sidebars and bias calibration.
