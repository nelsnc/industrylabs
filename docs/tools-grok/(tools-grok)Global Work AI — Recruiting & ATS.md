Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered job search platform for

candidates to beat ATS with automated tools.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Global Work Al, operating under

Expert Remote Inc., is an Al-native job-search platform designed exclusively for job

seekers, particularly those targeting remote and worldwide opportunities. It aggregates

over 1 million verified remote roles monthly from more than 70,000 sources, ensuring 100%

scam-free listings with no ads or duplicates. The platform's core value lies in its "Al vs. Al"

architecture, which counters employer-side Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) by

automating resume and cover letter customization to maximize keyword matches and pass

initial screens.


Key differentiators include its adversarial approach to the "broken" recruitment system,

where candidates face black-hole applications and ghosting. Unlike traditional job boards

like LinkedIn or Indeed, which prioritize employers, Global Work Al empowers candidates

with tools to "fight Al with Al." It features an Al CV Builder that restructures and optimizes

resumes based on job descriptions, generating hyper-personalized versions. The Al-

assisted application tool, including an Auto-Fill browser extension, saves users over 100

hours monthly by injecting tailored data into third-party forms without needing API

integrations.
Upcoming features like Mia Al—a J.A.R.V.I.S.-style career assistant—will expand into

agentic HR, handling negotiations, career mapping, upskilling recommendations, and

emotional support during job hunts. The platform supports 230+ job categories, focusing

on remote work globalization, enabling talent from regions like Poland or Nigeria to apply

for USD/EUR-paying roles with polished English communications.


Target users are individual job seekers in a competitive market, especially post-2023 tech

layoffs, where roles receive thousands of applications. It's ideal for mid-career

professionals seeking efficiency in high-volume applying. Main use cases include: (1) ATS

optimization for keyword stuffing without detection; (2) Automated high-volume

applications (100+ jobs via policy); (3) Scam-free job aggregation; (4) Personalized cover

letters and resume tailoring; (5) Pipeline tracking and real-time notifications.


The AI/ML approach uses generative models (likely based on LLMs like GPT variants) for

contextual rewriting, NLP for scam detection (vague descriptions, suspicious patterns),

and semantic matching for job recommendations. While B2C-focused, secondary B2B

streams exist via low-cost job postings ($9.99-$29). Risks include potential platform bans

for automation and ethical concerns over resume "hallucination." Overall, it's a disruptor in

the $5M ARR pivot from B2B to B2C, backed by $3.7M funding, but flagged for fake

reviews on Trustpilot, impacting credibility. (512 words)
