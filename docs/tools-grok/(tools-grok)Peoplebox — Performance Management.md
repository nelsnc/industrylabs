Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“’   Performance Management
Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered platform for OKRs,

performance reviews, and employee engagement.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Peoplebox.ai is a comprehensive

talent operating system designed for modern, tech-forward organizations, particularly in

engineering-led and product-focused environments. It integrates strategy execution

through OKRs with talent management, including performance reviews, 1:1 meetings, and

employee engagement tools. The platform addresses the fragmentation in HR tech stacks

by embedding workflows into daily tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, reducing friction

and boosting adoption. Key differentiators include automated goal updates via SQL queries

and native integrations with over 50 tools, creating a "single source of truth" for data. It

targets mid-market to enterprise companies (50+ employees), with a focus on high-growth

unicorns like Razorpay and Khatabook. The Al component, Nova, assists in drafting OKRs,

performance reviews, and bias mitigation, positioning it as an Al talent partner. Use cases

span goal alignment, continuous feedback, 360-degree reviews, pulse surveys, and

succession planning using the 9-box grid. The architecture is modular: OKR Platform for

automated tracking, Performance Management Suite for calibration and coaching, and

Employee Engagement Engine for surveys and CoffeeConnect. Security features include

SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliance, and role-based access control. Pricing is modular and

aggressive, starting at $7/user/month for Talent Management, with ROI driven by

administrative savings and productivity gains. Competitive positioning against Lattice,

15Five, and Betterworks emphasizes integration depth, agility, and price. Implementation

typically takes 2-3 weeks, with high adoption due to Slack-native interfaces. Overall,

Peoplebox transforms HR from compliance to strategic intelligence, accelerating

organizational velocity. (Validated against Gemini report, which matches core philosophy

and features; minor updates for 2025 context.)

  1.    Automated OKR tracking with SQL and native integrations for real-time updates.


  2. 360-degree performance reviews with calibration and 9-box grid for equity.

Ideal Company Sizes (select ALL that apply - CSV format):
O 1-50 employees
-       “51-200 employees


-’      201-500 employees


-“’     500+ employees

      Evidence for each:


- 1-50: Not supported; pricing tiers suggest mid-market focus, no explicit small

      business plans.

- 51-200: Quote from case studies like Nova Benefits (150+ employees); sweet spot per

      Gemini report.


- 201-500: Inferred from mid-market Professional plan ($12/user/mo).

- 500+: Premium plan with CSM for scaling organizations; Razorpay (1,000+

      employees).

      Company Size Notes (100 words max): Targets mid-market to enterprise; Professional

      plan for 50-500, Premium for 500+ with min $4,000 contract implying larger teams.

      Case studies show 150-1,000+ employees. Not ideal for very small teams due to

      integration complexity.
