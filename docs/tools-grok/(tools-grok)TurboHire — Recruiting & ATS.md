Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered ATS with resume parsing

and candidate ranking for efficient hiring.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): TurboHire is an enterprise-grade

Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that leverages augmented intelligence to streamline

talent acquisition processes. Founded in 2019, it transforms unstructured resumes into

structured "Smart Cards" with 98% parsing accuracy, enabling normalized comparisons

across candidates. The platform's core features include real-time candidate calibration

against job descriptions, bias reduction through data-focused screening, and multi-

channel sourcing via a browser extension. It supports six stakeholder experiences:

recruiters (bulk automation, one-click sourcing), candidates (login-less applications,

WhatsApp integration), interviewers (structured scorecards, one-way video interviews),

approvers (automated workflows), leadership (dashboards for metrics like cost-per-hire),

and administrators (role configuration). TurboHire integrates seamlessly with major HRIS

like SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM, and Workday, acting as an intelligence layer atop

systems of record. Key differentiators include its focus on high-volume hiring (e.g., campus

or blue-collar), mobile-first interfaces for emerging markets, and ROI claims of 69%

reduced time-to-hire and 23-65% cost savings. Targeted at mid-market to enterprise

organizations (50-500+ employees), it excels in industries like retail, fintech,

manufacturing, and publishing. The Al approach combines discriminative Al for

parsing/ranking with generative elements for feedback. Use cases span lateral hiring, walk-

in drives (handling 120,000 applications for Lenskart), and agency reduction (saving

$49,000 for Springer Nature). With ISO 27001, GDPR, and SOC 2 compliance, it ensures

data sovereignty. Backed by $9M in funding, TurboHire positions itself as a disruptor

against legacy ATS like Greenhouse and Lever, emphasizing ease of integration and

reduced cognitive load for users. (Word count: 312 - expandable with more details if

needed).
