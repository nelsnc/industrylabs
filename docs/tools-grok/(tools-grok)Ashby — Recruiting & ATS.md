Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): All-in-one recruiting platform with Al

for ATS, CRM, scheduling, analytics.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Ashby is an all-in-one recruiting

software designed for ambitious teams from startups to enterprises. It integrates ATS,

CRM, sourcing, scheduling, and analytics into a single platform, embedding Al

advancements at every layer. The platform is built for scale, ensuring Al is meaningful and

not just decorative. It offers tailored solutions for different company stages: for startups

(1-100 employees), it provides an easy-to-use product that scales; for growth-stage

companies (101-1000 employees), it delivers powerful tools for scaling organizations; and

for enterprises (1000+ employees), it supports sophisticated hiring needs. Ashby also

offers analytics that work on top of existing ATS. Customer testimonials highlight its

automation capabilities, customization, responsive support, and end-to-end recruiting

approach, noting improvements in productivity and collaboration. The platform aims to

enhance candidate experience, fairness in assessments, team productivity, data-driven

improvements, visibility, and diverse pipelines. Key differentiators include a unified data

model solving attribution issues in fragmented stacks, closed-loop analytics correlating

sourcing to hiring outcomes, and pragmatic Al for assistive tasks like resume screening and

feedback summarization. Target users are recruiting teams in tech-forward companies with

dedicated operations, not casual HR generalists. Main use cases: proactive sourcing via

Chrome extension and email sequences; complex scheduling for panels; structured

interviewing to reduce bias; advanced BI reporting without SQL. Al approach focuses on

utility, with governance for compliance like bias audits. (approx 350 words; expand with

Gemini details if needed for 500+).
