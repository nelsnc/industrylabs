Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered ATS with gamified

personality tests in local languages for efficient hiring.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Helio Al is an Al-driven recruiting platform designed to automate and streamline high-

volume hiring processes, particularly for frontline and multilingual roles. Founded in 2023

and headquartered in Tbilisi, Georgia, with a US-based entity, the company operates in six

countries and has screened over 300,000 applications for more than 300 international

brands. Its core philosophy shifts recruitment from manual, resume-centric workflows to

an "autonomous recruiting" model, addressing inefficiencies like high application volumes,

unreliable soft skills assessment, and language barriers in global hiring.

At its foundation, Helio Al integrates an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) with advanced Al

capabilities. The platform automates up to 70% of administrative tasks, including resume

screening, candidate scheduling, and FAQ resolution via an Al agent. This agent uses

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle candidate interactions across preferred

channels like WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, and email, ensuring engagement with Gen Z and

mobile-first workers. The Al parses unstructured CV data semantically, assigning match

scores based on context rather than keywords, allowing recruiters to prioritize relevant

candidates efficiently.
A key differentiator is the "play-to-reveal" gamified psychometric assessment—a 10-

minute situational game that evaluates personality traits like adaptability, emotional

intelligence, risk tolerance, and cognitive skills through real-time decisions. This bypasses

self-reported biases in traditional tests (e.g., Myers-Briggs), combining hard skills from

resumes with soft skills for a holistic "Whole candidate" score. The game enhances

candidate experience, reducing drop-off rates and positioning the employer as innovative.

Target users include lean HR teams in mid-market organizations (51-500 employees) facing

high-volume hiring in retail, logistics, and corporate sectors. Ideal buyer personas are HR

managers in multilingual environments, such as Eastern Europe or Asia, seeking cost-

effective alternatives to legacy ATS like Greenhouse or Lever. Main use cases include: (1)

High-volume screening for frontline roles, reducing time-to-hire by 3x; (2) Skills-based

hiring with bias mitigation through objective game data; (3) Global expansion with native

multi-lingual support for local dialects; (4) Automated candidate nurturing to keep talent

pipelines warm without manual effort.


Helio Al's Al/ML approach leverages proprietary algorithms for semantic NLP in multiple

languages, trained on diverse datasets to ensure accuracy across cultures. It emphasizes

agility with a low-barrier SaaS model—no implementation fees, instant activation, and

flexible subscriptions. While it lacks deep configurability for rigid enterprise workflows, it

excels in speed and candidate throughput, making it suitable for agile teams prioritizing

outcomes over processes.


Overall, Helio Al represents a Gen 3 recruiting tool, evolving from basic automation to

intelligent agents that liberate recruiters for strategic work. With recent $1M seed funding,

the platform is scaling globally, focusing on Al enhancements and market expansion. For

organizations like IndustryLabs, it offers a pivot to efficient, fair hiring, though compliance

verification (e.g., GDPR DPA) and integration with legacy HRIS should be confirmed pre-

adoption. (Word count: 528)
