Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered platform for recruiting,

payroll, and global HR management.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Bolto is a unified HR technology

platform that integrates recruiting, payroll, and global HR functions into a single system.

Designed for startups and growing companies, it eliminates the fragmentation between

talent acquisition and workforce management. Founded in 2023 and accelerated through Y

Combinator's S23 batch, Bolto leverages Al to automate candidate sourcing, vetting, and

onboarding, while handling payroll and compliance across borders.


The platform's core innovation is the "Hire-to-Pay" continuum, where candidate data from

recruiting flows seamlessly into employment contracts, payroll setup, and HR records. This

reduces data entry errors and compresses onboarding time from weeks to days. For

recruiting, Bolto uses Al to analyze GitHub repositories, portfolios, and behavioral signals

to pre-qualify software engineers and other technical talent. It operates as a marketplace

connecting companies with curated local recruiters, ensuring quality-guaranteed matches

with an average time-to-hire of 5.6 days for engineering roles.


In payroll and HRIS, Bolto offers U.S. payroll across 50 states with automated tax filings

(W-2/1099), benefits administration, and PEO services. Globally, it functions as an

Employer of Record (EOR) in 150+ countries, allowing entity-free hiring without local

subsidiaries. This includes handling local labor laws, currency disbursements, and statutory

benefits. Contractor management features prevent misclassification risks with

indemnification and localized contracts in 110+ currencies.


Key differentiators include its Al-driven vetting engine optimized for engineering hires,

"entity-free" expansion model, and integration with tools like QuickBooks, NetSuite,

Greenhouse, and Lever. Target users are high-growth startups focusing on remote-first

teams, particularly in software development. Main use cases: rapid technical hiring, global

team scaling without legal setup, unified payroll for employees and contractors, and

compliance automation for distributed workforces.

Bolto's Al/ML approach involves behavioral interviewing agents for soft skills assessment

and technical evaluations for hard skills, with human-in-the-loop review. Case studies

show 100% retention rates and significant efficiency gains, positioning Bolto as a

challenger to incumbents like Deel (EOR-focused) and Rippling (IT-heavy). With $5.1M in

seed funding, Bolto aims to disrupt the HR tech space by converting CapEx-heavy

expansion into OpEx.
