   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Autonomous Al recruiting agent for

sourcing, screening, and scheduling.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Tezi's Max is an autonomous Al recruiting partner designed to handle end-to-end talent

acquisition workflows, from sourcing to scheduling, for tech-forward companies. Founded

in 2024 by Raghavendra Prabhu (ex-Thumbtack, Covariant Al) and Jason James (ex-

Instacart, Intercom), Tezi addresses the "Iron Triangle" of hiring—speed, quality, and cost—

by leveraging agentic Al to automate tedious tasks, allowing human recruiters to focus on

high-value activities like closing candidates.


Max operates as an active agent rather than a passive tool, mimicking a human recruiter. It

begins with contextual calibration, where users provide job descriptions and refine

preferences through iterative feedback on sample profiles, capturing tacit "vibe checks" for

seniority and expertise. Once calibrated, Max sources from a 750 million profile database

aggregated from Linkedin, GitHub, StackOverflow, and other sources, using skill adjacency

models for semantic matching (e.g., inferring Python proficiency from Flask experience).


Outreach is hyper-personalized via LLMs, drafting emails referencing candidate specifics

and managing drip campaigns with frequency caps to avoid spam filters. For screening,

Max parses resumes, ranks applicants, conducts chat-based knockout questions, and

generates explainable scorecards. Scheduling integrates with Google Calendar/Outlook,

handling negotiations, invites, and internal nudges for scorecard submissions.


Key differentiators include its "Service-as-Software" model, enterprise-grade security

(SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliant), and seamless integrations with ATS like Greenhouse and

Lever. Target users are founders at early-stage startups, Heads of Talent at growth

companies, and Recruiting Ops leaders seeking vendor consolidation. Ideal for

desk/knowledge worker roles with rich digital footprints.
Main use cases: (1) Autonomous sourcing for hard-to-fill tech roles, reviewing thousands

of profiles hourly; (2) Inbound application management, surfacing top 5-10% from high-

volume backlogs; (3) Logistics automation, reducing scheduling time-sinks; (4) Bias

mitigation through audited Al decisions with human-in-the-loop for rejections. Tezi's Al

approach combines proprietary data graphs with third-party LLMs (likely

OpenAl/Anthropic) for personalization, emphasizing explainability to build trust. Early

adopters report Max acting like a "10-person team," with one case resurfacing 29 buried

candidates leading to a hire in one month. Risks include potential ecosystem spam if scaled

industry-wide and regulatory scrutiny under EU Al Act. Overall, Tezi positions Max as the

vanguard of Gen 4 recruiting tech, democratizing elite heuristics for non-enterprise buyers.
