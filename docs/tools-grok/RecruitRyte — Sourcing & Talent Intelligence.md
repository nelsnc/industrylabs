   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered sourcing platform for

semantic candidate matching and outreach.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): recruitRyte is a conversational Al

recruitment sourcing platform designed for outbound recruiting, enabling users to search,

screen, and engage candidates with precision at scale using reasoning-based shortlisting

and contextual signals rather than keywords. Built for professionals in talent acquisition

teams, in-house recruiters, hiring managers, startup founders, executive search firms,

staffing agencies, and independent recruiters, it excels in sourcing for niche, senior, or

hard-to-fill roles. Unlike traditional ATS systems focused on inbound applications,

recruitRyte prioritizes active sourcing from a global database of over 800 million profiles,

aggregated from public sources like social media, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.

The platform's core functionality revolves around a simple workflow: users input a job

description, resume, or LinkedIn profile in plain English, and the Al performs contextual

searches, ranking candidates based on role intent, adjacent domains, and real experience

signals. It addresses vocabulary mismatches by using vector-based semantic search,

achieving claimed match accuracy over 90% compared to keyword methods. Key

differentiators include adjacency and look-alike discovery for comparable career

trajectories, conversational refinement for natural adjustments (e.g., seniority or

industries), and assisted outreach with personalized messaging across email, LinkedIn

InMail, SMS, or social media. The Al assistant, Ria, supports natural language queries for

candidate searches.

Target users are SMBs, independent recruiters, and boutique agencies seeking cost-

effective alternatives to premium tools like LinkedIn Recruiter. Ideal buyer personas include

generalist recruiters needing to democratize advanced sourcing without Boolean expertise,

or teams handling passive talent pipelines. Main use cases encompass semantic candidate

discovery for hard-to-fill roles, automated screening with gap analysis, hyper-personalized

outreach campaigns, and integration with existing ATS for seamless data flow. The Al/ML

approach leverages NLP, vector space modeling, and LLMs for semantic understanding,

bias detection in job descriptions, and generative content like interview questions or

Boolean strings.
recruitRyte positions itself as a "best-of-breed" point solution in the unbundled HR tech

stack, augmenting legacy ATS with generative Al capabilities. lt emphasizes ethical Al

through third-party governance via Fairly Al and ISO standards, focusing on transparency

and auditability. While bootstrapped, it offers rapid iteration on features like job analyzer for

DEI optimization and prescreening question generators. Limitations include dependency on

public data availability and lack of high-volume inbound features. Overall, it redefines

sourcing by decoupling it from administrative tasks, flattening hierarchies in TA teams, and

providing enterprise-grade intelligence at accessible pricing for mass-market adoption.
