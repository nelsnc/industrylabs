Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered sourcing tool that scans

850M+ profiles for precise candidate matches.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Pin is an Al-powered recruitment

platform that automates key aspects of the hiring process, focusing on sourcing, outreach,

and coordination to reduce time-to-hire by up to 70%. Built for in-house talent acquisition

teams at high-growth tech companies and enterprises, Pin acts as an external intelligence

layer overlaying existing ATS systems. Its core functionality includes Al-driven resume

screening with "PhD-level precision" to evaluate skills, experience, and potential,

eliminating the need for manual Boolean searches. The platform aggregates data from over

850 million global profiles, creating "Golden Records" by triangulating sources like

LinkedIn, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and personal portfolios. This enables semantic searches

based on natural language prompts, such as "Senior Product Designer in NYC with FinTech

experience at early-stage startups," and "Lookalike" modeling to find candidates matching

top performers’ vector fingerprints.


Once candidates are identified, Pin's Engagement Agent handles multichannel outreach

across email, Linkedin, and SMS, generating hyper-personalized messages with contextual

details (e.g., referencing recent anniversaries or GitHub repos) to achieve a claimed 48%

response rate—far above the 10-15% industry average for cold outreach. Sequences are

orchestrated intelligently: Day 1 LinkedIn connection, instant message if accepted, Day 3

email, Day 6 SMS if compliant. Autonomous scheduling parses candidate replies for intent

(e.g., "free next Tuesday afternoon") and books calendar invites via integrated

Google/Outlook calendars, reducing "Calendar Tetris."

Pin emphasizes team collaboration with a shared multi-channel inbox for real-time

updates, comments, and assignments, supporting diversity hiring through filters for

representative pipelines and multi-company management for agencies or conglomerates.

As an ATS companion, it offers bi-directional integrations with platforms like Greenhouse,

Lever, and Bullhorn, with granular triggers to export only engaged candidates, maintaining

data hygiene. Analytics track funnel metrics like open/reply rates, hire quality, and diversity.
Key differentiators include its "Recruiter's Eye" algorithm analyzing 300,000+ data points

per resume (e.g., promotion velocity at companies like McKinsey), inferred skill ontologies

to fill gaps, and a credit-based system for contact lookups (1,000-3,000/month per tier) to

ensure targeted sourcing. Target users are sourcers and recruiters handling high-volume

roles, especially in tech, where passive talent discovery is critical. Main use cases: top-of-

funnel automation for empty pipelines, diversity sourcing, and scaling outreach without

spam risks. Pin's Al leverages LLMs, vector embeddings, and autonomous agents for

semantic understanding and agentic execution, moving beyond keyword matching.

Security features include SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, with data encrypted in transit/rest.

Since launching in stealth with $3M funding, Pin positions itself as a cost-effective

alternative to LinkedIn Recruiter ($8,000+/year), starting at $149/user/month. (Word

count: 512)
