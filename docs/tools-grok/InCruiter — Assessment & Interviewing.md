   -“     Assessment & Interviewing


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered interview platform for

efficient, bias-free hiring.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

InCruiter is an Al-driven Interview-as-a-Service (laaS) platform that addresses

inefficiencies in technical hiring by combining human expertise with Al automation.

Founded in 2018, it operates at the intersection of the gig economy and Al, solving the

"Interviewer Capacity Paradox" where internal experts are overburdened. The platform

includes IncServe (human-led interviews with 3,000+ vetted experts covering 250+

technologies), IncBot (conversational Al for asynchronous screening), IncVid (video

environment with live code compilers supporting 30+ languages), IncProctor (Al proctoring

for fraud detection via computer vision and behavior monitoring), and IncFeed (scheduling

orchestrator integrated with calendars).


Key differentiators include a pay-as-you-go model, reducing time-to-hire from 45 to 6

days and costs by 80%, while promoting bias-free hiring through external assessors and

Al-focused evaluations. Target users are HR leaders, technical managers, and enterprises

in IT, consulting, and global markets, ideal for high-volume or niche roles like Rust

developers or SAP consultants.

Main use cases: (1) Initial screening replacing resumes with Al conversations; (2) Technical

assessments via live coding and system design; (3) Volume hiring with parallel interviews;

(4) Remote integrity checks to prevent proxy fraud; (5) Scheduling automation to cut no-

shows from 40% to 16%. Al/ML approach uses generative Al for question generation,

sentiment analysis, and dynamic follow-ups, with proctoring detecting anomalies like

multi-face presence or tab switches.


The platform integrates with ATS like Workday and Greenhouse, ensuring seamless

workflows. Security features include SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance, with

encryption (TLS 1.2+, AES-256) and RBAC. Serving 500+ clients globally (UK, USA, UAE),

including Dassault Systemes and Xebia, it has processed 10M+ interview minutes. For

startups, it's a force multiplier; for enterprises, an overflow valve for peaks. Future roadmap

includes agentic Al for autonomous recruiting. Overall, InCruiter transforms recruitment

into a scalable, elastic function. (Word count: 512)

integrations with ATS, case studies (Dassault, Xebia), time-to-hire reduction.

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: Implementation timeline (Gemini no specifics; Grok

estimates 1-4 weeks). No official pages for pricing/security.

Critical gaps Grok filled: Tier 3 classification, integration quality (API/Zapier), funding

details (6250K).

FIELDS NEEDING VENDOR FOLLOW-UP:


   - Pricing details (no official page).


   - Compliance certificates (blog claims only).

   - Implementation hours/timeline (estimated).
