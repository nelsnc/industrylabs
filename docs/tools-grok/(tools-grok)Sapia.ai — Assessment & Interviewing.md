Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al chat-based interviewer for bias-free

high-volume hiring.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Sapia.ai, formerly PredictiveHire, is an Al-driven platform revolutionizing high-volume

hiring by replacing resumes with blind, text-based chat interviews. Founded in 2018 and

rebranded in 2022, it focuses on ethical Al to enhance speed, quality, and diversity in

recruitment. The core Smart Interviewer uses NLP and deep learning, trained on over 12

million responses from 3 million candidates across 47 countries, to assess competencies

like HEXACO personality traits, adaptability, and customer orientation.
The platform's blind assessment strips demographic markers, reducing unconscious bias,

and provides explainable Al via SAIGETM for transparent scoring. It integrates generative Al

(Claude by Anthropic) for job analysis (JAS) and recruiter assistance (Tia), but limits it to

safe, structured tasks to avoid hallucinations. Video interviews are available post-chat but

human-reviewed to avoid biometric biases.


Target users include enterprises in retail, logistics, hospitality, and contact centers facing

application deluges. Ideal for roles where soft skills matter more than experience, it

supports multilingual interviews and knock-out questions. Key differentiators: Candidate-

centric with feedback for all (driving 9/10 satisfaction), FAIRTM framework for bias

monitoring (4/5ths rule, Cohen's d), and data sovereignty via regional subsidiaries (UK, US,

Australia).

Use cases: High-volume screening (e.g., Woolworths: 1M apps/year, <24h ad-to-offer),

diversity uplift (Qantas: 2.5x offer rate), turnover reduction (Starbucks: 56%). Al approach:

Hybrid rule-based and deep learning (BERT models) ensures job-relevance, with

continuous auditing for compliance (GDPR, EEOC, ISO 27001, SOC 2). As CVs become

obsolete due to generative Al, Sapia positions itself for skills-based hiring, turning

recruitment into a brand-building tool via "ROI of Hope."


Key Features (5-8 bullet points - CSV-ready):

   1.              Asynchronous chat interviews with 5-7 behavioral questions
