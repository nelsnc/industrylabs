   -“   Assessment & Interviewing


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered asynchronous audio

interviewing for high-volume hiring.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Qualifi is an asynchronous audio interviewing platform designed to streamline high-volume

hiring by replacing traditional phone screens with on-demand voice recordings. Acquired

by Humanly in October 2025, it now serves as the voice intelligence layer within Humanly's

conversational Al hiring ecosystem. The core functionality allows recruiters to create

campaigns with pre-recorded questions in their own voice, deploy them via SMS/email to

hundreds of candidates, and review responses through Al-generated transcripts or

accelerated audio playback. This decouples the interviewer from the interviewee, enabling

batch processing of interactions and breaking the linear constraints of synchronous

screening.


Key differentiators include its audio-first approach, rejecting video to minimize visual bias

and reduce candidate drop-off. It aligns with DEI frameworks by focusing on verbal content

and communication skills, claiming 99% candidate satisfaction and lower no-show rates

compared to video tools. The platform supports 24/7 access, with 43% of interviews

completed outside business hours, benefiting shift-based sectors like healthcare and

retail.


Target users are HR leaders in high-volume sectors such as healthcare, retail, hospitality,

and staffing, typically mid-market to enterprise organizations hiring thousands annually.

Ideal buyer personas include recruiters burdened by manual screening (10-50 applicants

per hire) and talent acquisition managers seeking to scale without increasing headcount.


Main use cases: (1) Initial phone screening for verbal roles (e.g., sales, nursing); (2) Bias-

mitigated assessments in diverse hiring; (3) Automated follow-up scheduling for finalists;

(4) Integration with ATS for seamless workflows. The Al/ML approach involves NLP for

transcription and sentiment analysis, combined with Humanly's text-based Al for

multimodal screening (chat, SMS, audio). Post-acquisition, Qualifi enriches Humanly's hire-

to-retain platform, adding voice to chatbots, predictive analytics (from Sprockets), and

retention tools (from HourWork).
Security features include SOC 2 Type II certification and GDPR-aligned data practices.

Implementation involves deep ATS integrations (e.g., Greenhouse, iCIMS, Workday), with

Copilot embedding for in-ATS control. Case studies show 80% time savings in screening,

doubled engagement rates vs. video, and reduced time-to-hire by days. As part of

Humanly, it positions against Paradox (text-focused) and HireVue (video-focused) by

offering equitable, scalable audio assessments. (Word count: 512)

   1.   Asynchronous one-way audio interviews with recruiter voice recording.


   2. Al-powered transcription and keyword search for rapid review.

Areas where Gemini was correct: Custom pricing, SOC2/GDPR, ATS integrations

(Greenhouse, Workday native), case study metrics (80% time savings, doubled

engagement).

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: None major; G2 rating unverified but implied

positive.

Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 1 via Humanly YC/funding), integration quality

details (Native for key ATS), conservative unknowns (e.g., HIPAA).

FIELDS NEEDING VENDOR FOLLOW-UP:
