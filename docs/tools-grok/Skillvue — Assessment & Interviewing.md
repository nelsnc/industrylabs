Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al platform for objective skills

assessment in recruitment and talent management.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Skillvue is an Al-driven platform designed to facilitate a skills-based approach in HR

processes, shifting from traditional credential-focused hiring to objective competency

evaluation. Founded in 2021 in Milan, Italy, as Algo Al S.r.l. (now Algo Job S.r.l.), the

company addresses the global skills crisis by enabling enterprises to assess, map, and

develop talent at scale. Its core innovation lies in "Skills Assessment Agents," dynamic Al

entities that conduct multidimensional evaluations across hard skills (e.g., coding,

languages), soft skills (via automated Behavioral Event Interviews), and motivational

alignment. This automation democratizes psychometric profiling, traditionally requiring

trained interviewers, making it feasible for high-volume recruitment and internal mobility.


The platform deconstructs roles into constituent skills, measures them bias-free without

relying on CVs, and predicts learning potential. For recruitment, it verifies competencies

through quizzes, challenges, and asynchronous interviews, reducing time-to-hire by up to

42% and increasing candidate eligibility by 40%, as seen in deployments at Carrefour

(30,000 applicants/year) and Credem. Internally, it maps organizational skills landscapes,

identifies hidden talent for redeployment, and personalizes learning & development (L&D)

by pinpointing gaps, such as analytical potential without specific tool proficiency. This dual

focus on acquisition and management positions Skillvue as infrastructure for Skills-Based

Organizations (SBOs), where talent is a fluid portfolio rather than fixed roles.

Key differentiators include its European origins, ensuring native GDPR and EU Al Act

compliance, and flexibility with 150+ ready-to-use tests plus bespoke options. Unlike chat-

first tools, Skillvue's multimodal approach (text, video, quizzes) creates comprehensive

"digital twins" of candidates, ideal for complex roles in banking, insurance, and retail.

Target users are CHROs and talent leaders in mid-to-large enterprises (200+ employees)

facing talent shortages and DE&I challenges. Main use cases: streamlining pre-screening

to eliminate CV bias, enabling data-driven internal promotions, and linking assessments to

personalized training paths. AIl/ML leverages NLP for soft skills analysis and psychometric

models like BEI for predictive validity (5x better than CV reviews). With €9.5M in funding

and clients like Unipol and Douglas, Skillvue is expanding beyond Italy, targeting Germany

and Canada while scaling its team to 30 by end-2025.
