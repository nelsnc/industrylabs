Primary Category (select ONE):


   -“   Assessment & Interviewing


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered video interviewing with

resume scoring and psychometric assessments.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Interviewer.Al is a Singapore-based Al-driven video interviewing platform founded in 2018,

designed to streamline the pre-screening process in recruitment. It operates as an

intelligent selection tool within the HR Technology landscape, specifically in Recruiting &

ATS and Performance Management categories. Unlike traditional ATS systems that rely on

keyword matching, Interviewer.Al integrates asynchronous video interviews, automated

resume parsing, and psychometric profiling to filter candidates efficiently, addressing the

top-of-funnel bottleneck where hundreds of applications are screened manually.


The platform's core architecture processes three data streams: textual (resumes), visual

(video), and behavioral (psychometrics). Resume Scoring 2.0 uses OCR and NLP with NER

to analyze context, trained on 120 million resumes, providing an Absolute Al Score based

on semantic proximity to job descriptions. WorkMap Assessment employs a 7-point Likert

scale across 25-35 statements to evaluate soft skills like Resilience or Analytical Thinking,

grounded in I/O psychology. Al Video Intelligence analyzes facial landmarks for

engagement, voice prosody for energy, and NLP for content relevancy, scoring dimensions

like Professionalism and Sociability.


Key differentiators include Explainable Al (XAI), offering granular, auditable scores to

mitigate bias and comply with regulations. The Interview Fraud Checklist detects tab

switching, third-party voices, and gaze anomalies to ensure integrity. Operational

workflows feature Al-generated JDs and questions, stack-ranked dashboards, and

collaborative tools for multiple users.

Target users are mid-market and high-growth enterprises (e.g., Emaar, Goama Games) with

lean HR teams, focusing on roles requiring communication skills. Use cases include global

distributed hiring and high-velocity event recruitment, reducing screening time by ~80%.

The candidate experience emphasizes accessibility with no-login options and mock

interviews for practice.


Compliance includes GDPR readiness with EU data residency, SOC 2, and ISO 27001.

Security uses SSL encryption and AWS/GCP infrastructure. Pricing is tiered: Starter

(~$53/mo), Professional ($67-149/mo), Enterprise (custom), ~23% below category

average.
Integrations are native with Greenhouse and Calendly, with Zapier for 5,000+ apps.

Compared to HireVue (enterprise-focused), Spark Hire (recording-only), and Willo (simple

async), Interviewer.Al balances Al assessment with affordability for SMBs.

Overall, Interviewer.Al positions as a "Glass Box" Al tool, enhancing transparency in an era

of regulatory scrutiny, with proven efficiency gains in diverse environments. (512 words)

GEMINI VALIDATION SUMMARY:

Areas where Gemini was correct: Pricing tiers/ranges ($49-149/mo USD), GDPR/SOC2/ISO

claims, integrations (Greenhouse native, Zapier), case studies (Goama/Emaar), features

(resume/video/psychometrics).

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: SOC2/ISO not in privacy policy (claimed in

doc/marketing). Pricing variance in G2 ($500-850, likely annual).

Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 3), integration quality details (Native/API/Zapier),

GBP conversions, confidence levels.

FIELDS NEEDING VENDOR FOLLOW-UP:


   - SOC2/ISO certificates (claimed but no evidence).

   * HIPAA/EEOC (unknown).


   - Free trial duration (mentioned but unspecified).


   - Implementation timeline (estimated, no official).


   - Demo video URL (not found).
RESEARCH QUALITY NOTES: Pricing consistent across sources, minor G2 variance

possibly outdated. Compliance claims in doc but sparse in policy; assume valid but need

certs. Integrations limited to few native, broad via Zapier. Conservative on unknowns like

exact trial days.
