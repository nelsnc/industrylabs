Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered Talent Data Cloud for

sourcing and talent intelligence in mid-enterprise.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Findem, headquartered in Redwood City, California, positions itself as a comprehensive

Talent Data Cloud rather than a traditional sourcing tool. It addresses recruitment

bottlenecks by aggregating "3D Data" from over 100,000 sources, including person,

company, and time-series data, to create dynamic candidate profiles. This enables

"Attribute-Based Search" for complex criteria like "scaling teams from Series B to IPO" or

"quota attainment in high-velocity sales," surpassing keyword-based methods.


The platform integrates Assistive Al for automating screening and outreach, Agentic Al for

autonomous workflows like "Intelligent Job Post" that plans searches and targets

candidates, and Build Al for custom models using "Success Signals" tailored to

organizational needs. It consolidates sourcing, CRM, and market intelligence, integrating

with ATS systems for bi-directional sync to refresh data and resurface candidates.


Targeted at mid-market to enterprise (51-500+ employees), Findem suits high-growth

sectors like technology, healthcare, and finance, where specialized roles require verified

attributes. Use cases include surge hiring (e.g., doubling teams quickly), diversity sourcing

(460% funnel improvement in cases), and internal mobility. Its Al emphasizes explainability,

verifying claims against sources like GitHub or patents, aligning with ethical standards.
Differentiators include verified data freshness (30 days), warm path prioritization, and

consolidation reducing tech spend by up to 67%. While powerful, it requires a mindset shift

from keywords to attributes, with a steep learning curve noted in reviews. Overall, Findem

transforms recruitment from reactive to strategic, backed by $105M funding and clients

like Adobe and RingCentral. (Validated against Gemini report: Matches core architecture

and value prop; no discrepancies.)

   1.   Attribute-Based Search using 3D Data for complex candidate filtering.


   2. Copilot for automated sourcing and outreach planning.
