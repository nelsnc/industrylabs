Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al agents Jack (candidate advocate)

and Jill (corporate recruiter) for efficient hiring.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Jack & Jill Al is a London-based

platform founded in early 2025 that deploys autonomous Al agents to revolutionize

recruitment. The dual-agent system consists of "Jack," the candidate-side agent, and "Jill,"

the employer-side agent, forming a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that handles end-to-end

hiring without traditional intermediaries. Jack engages job seekers through conversational

interviews, capturing nuanced data like career goals, salary expectations, and skills via

voice or chat. It scans 10,000 jobs hourly, provides tailored recommendations, assists with

applications, preps for interviews, and facilitates direct intros to hiring managers. This

creates a "career therapy" experience, fostering honesty and long-term engagement, with

49,000 candidates engaged overall and 42,000 in London. Jill, on the demand side,

extracts role requirements from hiring managers via probing conversations, semantically

matches candidates from Jack's network, vets them autonomously, and delivers shortlists

directly to inboxes. This bypasses resume black holes and keyword matching, focusing on

transferable skills and fit. Key differentiators include rejection of SaaS subscriptions for a

10% success fee model, half the cost of agencies, with a 3-month money-back guarantee.

The platform acts as an "External ATS," pre-processing candidates for integration with

systems like Workday or Greenhouse, though explicit APIs are not documented. Target

users are fast-growing startups and scale-ups in tech, with mid-to-senior roles; ideal

personas include busy hiring managers in 50-500 employee companies seeking cost-

effective, high-quality talent pipelines. Main use cases: high-volume sourcing in

competitive markets, reducing time-to-hire from weeks to days, and improving candidate

experience to minimize ghosting. Al approach leverages LLMs for natural language

understanding, voice synthesis (likely via ElevenLabs angels), and agentic planning for

long-horizon tasks like negotiation. Backed by $20M seed from Creandum and others,

including Anthropic angels, ensuring advanced AI capabilities. Risks include data privacy in

voice biometrics and potential bias in matching, mitigated by GDPR compliance as a UK

entity. Overall, Jack & Jill positions itself as "Service-as-Software," automating the recruiter

role entirely rather than augmenting it, targeting the $200B global recruiting market.

Company Size Notes (100 words max): Marketing targets fast-growing companies with

fluctuating hiring needs; testimonials from VC-backed startups (50-300 employees).
