Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-hybrid sourcing tool with human

curation for passive candidate outreach.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Fetcher, operated by Tiplinks Inc., is

a hybrid Al-powered talent sourcing and outreach platform designed to automate the top-

of-funnel recruitment process. Founded in 2015, it pivoted from a mobile networking app

(Caliber) to focus on B2B enterprise sourcing, addressing the limitations of legacy ATS

systems by proactively identifying passive candidates. The platform's core architecture

revolves around a "batch-based" delivery system: recruiters input role criteria (skills,

experience, location, DEI goals), and Fetcher's Al scans a database of over 500 million

profiles to generate matches. In higher tiers like Amplify, human sourcers review and curate

these batches for precision, reducing false positives common in pure Al tools. Feedback

loops (Good Fit/Bad Fit) retrain the algorithm per role, enhancing accuracy over time.
Key differentiators include its "human-in-the-loop" (HITL) model, which combines machine

learning with expert verification, making it suitable for generalist recruiters who lack time

for complex searches. Unlike search-focused competitors (e.g., HireEZ), Fetcher

emphasizes "done-for-you" service, delivering ready-to-contact leads. It integrates a full

CRM for automated email sequences, personalization tokens, and sentiment analysis on

replies (categorizing as Interested/Not Interested/Later), streamlining inbox management.

The Chrome extension enables one-click profile capture from LinkedIn, enriching data with

contact info. DEI features like blind sourcing and pipeline analytics help mitigate bias and

track demographics.


Target users are mid-market growth companies (50-500 employees) with lean TA teams

(1-5 recruiters), particularly for knowledge worker roles in sales, marketing, product, and

engineering. Main use cases include outbound recruiting for hard-to-fill positions,

reducing agency fees, and accelerating time-to-hire through automated multi-touch

campaigns (6-8 touchpoints for passive candidates). The Al approach leverages

reinforcement learning from user feedback, aggregated data from public sources

(LinkedIn, GitHub), and natural language processing for sentiment. Integrations with ATS

like Greenhouse and Lever ensure seamless data flow, with bi-directional sync for learning

from hire outcomes. Security is enterprise-grade with SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, and CCPA

compliance. ROI stems from time savings (17 hours/role), agency displacement ($20K-

30K/hire), and faster hiring velocity. Customer stories highlight 37-59% response rates

and pipeline expansion (e.g., 3,820 candidates for Catalyst). Overall, Fetcher positions

itself as a force multiplier, blending automation with human judgment for scalable, ethical

recruiting. (512 words)

SECTION 9: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

Primary Competitors (2-3 tools):


   1.   HireEZ - search-first Al sourcing


   2. SeekOut - data/diversity-focused

   3. Gem - CRM/workflow emphasis


Key Differentiator (100 words max): Hybrid HITL model (Al + human curation) for curated

batches vs. DIY searches. Quote: "Fetcher’s human-in-the-loop architecture ensures

precision where pure Al falls short" (from blog). Stronger ease of setup (G2: 10.0 vs HireEZ

8.3), but lower on deep search (8.7 vs 9.4). Complements LinkedIn by enabling email

outreach.
