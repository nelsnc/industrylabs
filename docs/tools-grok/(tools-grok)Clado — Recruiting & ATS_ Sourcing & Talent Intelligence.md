Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered search over 800M+

profiles for recruiting and sales teams.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Clado's Atlas is an all-in-one

platform for state-of-the-art deep research and profile enrichment, designed for recruiting

and sales teams. It deploys over 100,000 Al agents to search and analyze hundreds of

millions of unique profiles using natural language queries. Core functionality includes

complex criteria matching (e.g., skills, experience, education), profile enrichment with

contact details like email and phone, and unified profiles aggregating data from sources

such as LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, and Google Scholar. Key differentiators are its agentic

search, which goes beyond keyword matching to perform deep research asynchronously,

and high-precision contact enrichment with SOTA performance. Target users include

recruiters sourcing candidates, sales development reps prospecting leads, and VCs

monitoring founders. Main use cases: talent sourcing for high-volume hiring (e.g., finding

engineers with specific tenure or skills), sales prospecting (e.g., identifying decision-

makers based on post reactions), and venture scouting (e.g., notifications for new founders

matching criteria). The Al/ML approach involves a swarm of agents for intent

decomposition, distributed retrieval, cross-verification, and synthesis, enabling nuanced

queries like "poachable engineers." Outputs are presentation-ready with swappable

criteria. The platform supports team collaboration, shared projects, and API integration for

custom workflows. Clients include YC-backed firms like Bolto and Terac, praising time

savings and search quality. While focused on B2B, it handles 25-10,000+ results per query,

scaling for enterprise needs.


Key Features (5-8 bullet points - CSV-ready):

   1.   Complex criteria matching over 800M+ profiles.


   2. Profile enrichment including email, phone, GitHub, Google Scholar.

GEMINI VALIDATION SUMMARY:

Areas where Gemini was correct: SOC 2 in observation, usage-based pricing, competitors

(LinkedIn, Apollo, Clay), notable customers implied.

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: Gemini estimated $0.01/credit vaguely; Grok

details costs. Gemini implied more integrations; Grok finds limited. No implementation in

Gemini.

Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 1, YC X25), integration quality (mostly Not

Supported), compliance additions (ISO 27001).
