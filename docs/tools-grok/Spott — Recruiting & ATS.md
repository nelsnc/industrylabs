Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-native ATS/CRM for agencies

automating sourcing, outreach, and reporting.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Spott positions itself as the operating system for the next generation of recruitment

agencies, fundamentally reimagining the role of the Applicant Tracking System (ATS).

Traditionally, ATS platforms have functioned as passive data repositories—digital filing

cabinets where recruiters manually log activities. Spott disrupts this model by functioning

as an active, Al-driven partner that participates in the recruitment workflow.

At its core, Spott is an Al-native ATS and CRM designed to consolidate the fragmented tool

stack typical of modern agencies. Recruitment firms often rely on a patchwork of

subscription services: a CRM for data storage (e.g., Bullhorn), a sequencing tool for

outreach (e.g., SourceWhale), a scheduler (e.g., Calendly), and a transcription tool (e.g.,

Otter.ai). Spoott integrates these functionalities into a single platform, eliminating data silos

and reducing subscription fatigue.

The platform’s architecture is built around three proprietary Al capabilities that distinguish

it from legacy competitors:
Natural Language Sourcing: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Spott allows

recruiters to query their proprietary database using conversational language (e.g., "Show

me Java developers in London who have worked at Fintech startups") rather than complex

Boolean strings. This democratizes data access, allowing junior recruiters to surface

candidates with the sophistication of seasoned researchers.


Automated Candidate Reporting (Spec CVs): One of the most time-consuming tasks for

executive search firms is the creation of "Candidate Packets" or "Spec CVs"—formatted

documents presenting a candidate to a client. Spott’s Al agent ingests raw CVs, interview

notes, and job descriptions to generate these reports in seconds, adhering to the agency’s

specific branding and tone. This feature alone targets a massive reduction in non-revenue-

generating administrative time.

Active Meeting Intelligence: Beyond simple transcription, Spott’s "Meeting Co-Pilot" joins

candidate interviews via Zoom/Teams, transcribes the conversation, and—crucially—

automatically updates the corresponding fields in the CRM (e.g., salary expectations,

notice period) based on the dialogue. This ensures data hygiene without manual data entry,

solving the perennial problem of "dirty data" in agency CRMs.


Target Users: The tool is explicitly and exclusively designed for Recruitment Agencies,

Staffing Firms, and Executive Search Consultancies. It is engineered to support the

workflow of "Headhunters" and "360-Recruiters" whose primary metric is placement

revenue. It is not built for internal Talent Acquisition teams, as evidenced by the lack of

internal approval chains, offer letter generation for payroll, or integrations with HRIS

platforms like Workday.


Key Differentiators: Spott’s primary differentiator is its "Al-Native" status. While

incumbents like Bullhorn are scrambling to add Al features via acquisitions or partnerships,

Spott was built in the post-generative Al era (founded 2024), meaning its data structure is

optimized for LLM interaction from day one. This allows for fluid agents that can "read" and

"write" database entries autonomously, a capability that bolt-on Al solutions struggle to

replicate due to legacy codebases. Additional features include automatic data enrichment,

LinkedIn Chrome Extension for sourcing, candidate & vacancy matching, and customizable

Al automations.

Evidence for each:


             1-50: Self-service nature and Essential tier pricing suggests ideal for boutiques.


             51-200: Sweet spot; case studies like Pauwels Consulting (200+ est.).

             201-500: Potential fit but increased implementation friction.


             500+: Low fit due to lack of enterprise certifications.
Company Size Notes (100 words max): Spott is calibrated for mid-market agencies (50-

200), with self-service onboarding for smaller teams. Larger firms may face data migration

challenges from legacy systems. No explicit 500+ support.
