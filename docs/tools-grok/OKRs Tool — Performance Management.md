Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered OKR software for startups

to set, track, and align goals fast.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): OKRs Tool is a streamlined, Al-

driven platform tailored for startups and small businesses to manage Objectives and Key

Results (OKRs) without the overhead of complex enterprise tools. Founded in 2024 and

acquired by Steven Macdonald in January 2025, it addresses common pain points in goal-

setting for early-stage teams, such as spreadsheet chaos, misaligned efforts, and low

adoption rates. The tool emphasizes simplicity, with instant setup requiring no consultants

or extensive training—users can generate OKRs in seconds using Al.


Core functionality revolves around creating hierarchical OKRs at company, department,

team, and individual levels, tracking progress in real-time, and maintaining alignment

through visual tools like the Alignment Map. This interactive graph shows goal

dependencies, helping teams identify bottlenecks and orphan objectives. Progress

tracking replaces traditional status meetings with async weekly check-ins, supported by

Slack notifications and automated nudges. Users update metrics and add narrative context,

separating quantitative progress from qualitative health indicators (e.g., confidence scoring

to flag risks).
Key differentiators include its flat-fee pricing model, which avoids per-user penalties

common in competitors, making it scalable for growing teams. Al integration acts as an

"always-on coach," drafting goals from prompts, critiquing manual entries for measurability

and ambition, and suggesting resource reallocations based on velocity. This reduces "blank

page syndrome" and ensures goals focus on outcomes over outputs. The platform also

includes advanced analytics for engagement metrics, anomaly detection, and proactive

insights, fostering a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.


Target users are overwhelmed founders, operations leads, and agile team managers in

startups (typically 1-50 or 51-200 employees). Ideal for bootstrapped or funded early-

stage SaaS, product, and agency teams who need quick wins without heavy administrative

burden. It excludes large enterprises requiring on-premise hosting or deep matrix

permissions, defaulting to transparency over silos.


Main use cases include: 1) Rapid goal-setting for quarterly planning, using templates for

functions like marketing, engineering, and HR; 2) Async progress monitoring to eliminate

Friday status calls; 3) Resource optimization by linking initiatives (projects) to key results;

4) Performance retrospectives with Al feedback loops; 5) Cross-team visibility to prevent

"strategy drift" in hybrid/remote setups.


The AI/ML approach leverages OpenAl for generative drafting and analysis, ensuring data

privacy (not used for training). Security is enterprise-grade, with SOC 2 alignment and

GDPR compliance inherited from infrastructure (Bubble.io on AWS). Users report 3x faster

fundraising, 40% reduced planning time, and improved metrics like retention and sales

lifts. Overall, OKRs Tool democratizes strategic execution, turning alignment from a

buzzword into operational rhythm for high-growth organizations. (Word count: 512)
