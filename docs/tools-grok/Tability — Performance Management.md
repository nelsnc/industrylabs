   -“’   Performance Management


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered OKR platform for

outcome-driven performance management.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Tability is a specialized strategy execution platform designed to facilitate the adoption and

management of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) in modern organizations. Founded in

2020 by former Atlassian engineers, it emphasizes outcome-driven performance over

traditional output metrics, aligning with the shift in knowledge economies toward remote

and hybrid workforces. Unlike bundled HRIS tools, Tability decouples goal tracking from

payroll and reviews, avoiding perverse incentives like sandbagging goals for compensation.


Core functionality includes Al-assisted goal creation via "Tabby," an OKR agent that

generates structured plans from prompts, provides coaching, and ensures SMART criteria

adherence. The Check-in Engine automates weekly updates through Slack/Teams/Email

reminders, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative narratives for contextual

insights. Strategy Maps offer dynamic visualizations of goal hierarchies, supporting flexible

alignments across matrixed teams. Operational dashboards automate reporting, health

views, and trend analysis, reducing manual effort.

Key differentiators: Privacy-first Al using OpenAl Enterprise API (data deleted after 30

days, no training on customer data); extensive integrations for auto-syncing metrics from

Salesforce, Jira, Tableau, etc.; focus on async workflows to respect maker time; and read-

only seats for affordable enterprise transparency. Target users are mid-market scale-ups

(51-500 employees) in tech/product/engineering, with strong adoption in fintech, edtech,

and healthtech. Main use cases: Quarterly OKR planning, weekly progress tracking, cross-

team alignment, and executive reporting. Al/ML approach: Generative Al for goal

drafting/coaching; potential future predictive analytics from historical data.

Tability positions itself against spreadsheets (static, no notifications), project tools

(output-focused), and HRIS (compensation-linked). In 2025, it evolved pricing to user-

based tiers (Basic $5/user/mo, Premium $8/user/mo, Enterprise custom), dropping

freemium for trials. Security includes SOC 2 Type II, GDPR compliance, regional hosting

(US/EU/AU), and SSO. Market events like Viva Goals sunset create opportunities, with

Tability scoring higher on G2 (4.7 vs 4.3). Case studies show ROI in time savings (80%

reporting reduction) and alignment (fewer meetings). Future trends: Deeper Al predictions,

bi-directional integrations. Overall, Tability bridges strategy-vision gaps for outcome-

driven teams, prioritizing simplicity and trust. (Word count: 512)
