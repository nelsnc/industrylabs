Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered recruitment platform for

automating sourcing, screening, and ranking talent.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Sourcio.ai is a specialized Al-driven

Talent Intelligence platform designed to automate key aspects of the recruitment process,

particularly for high-volume hiring in sectors like Retail, BPO, and Hospitality. It positions

itself as an "Al Hiring Agent" that goes beyond traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)

by leveraging generative Al to screen, rank, and evaluate candidates dynamically. The

platform integrates multi-model Al capabilities, allowing users to select from Large

Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-40 (OpenAl), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google),

and Grog for optimized performance based on cost, speed, and reasoning needs. This

flexibility enables cost-performance optimization: high-reasoning models for complex

roles and faster options for entry-level screening.


Core functionality includes automated resume parsing with semantic matching, where the

system converts resumes and job descriptions into vector embeddings to calculate fit

scores via cosine similarity. It supports inbound screening by uploading resumes or

importing from job boards, providing explainable scoring (e.g., "Matched on 5 years Python

experience") to aid compliance and bias reduction. Additional features encompass a

Kanban-style hiring pipeline for drag-and-drop candidate management, automated email

communications with personalization, calendar sync for scheduling (Outlook/Google), and

smart reminders to reduce no-shows. For agencies, it offers multi-company workspaces

and white-label links for client sharing.


Key differentiators include its multi-model Al core, which mitigates model lock-in and

allows switching during outages or price changes, and its aggressive pricing starting at

free for basic use, making it accessible for SMBs. Unlike legacy ATS like Taleo, which are

systems of record, Sourcio acts as a "System of Intelligence" with agentic Al that reasons

about candidate fit (e.g., inferring Java proficiency from Spring Boot experience) and

incorporates predictive analytics from past hiring data. It emphasizes data sovereignty with

EU-based storage options for GDPR compliance, and structured parsing to strip biases like

photos or fonts.


Target users are primarily mid-market recruiters and agencies handling high-volume, low-

complexity roles, such as screening 1,500 CVs/month on the Pro plan. Ideal buyer

personas include HR managers in SMBs (50-500 employees) seeking to offload screening

without enterprise costs, and agencies needing segregated client data.
Main use cases:


   - High-volume inbound screening for retail/customer service roles, reducing manual

        review time by 80-90%.


   - Automated shortlisting with explainable Al for defensible hiring decisions.


   - Integration as a "pre-screening firewall" with existing HRIS via Zapier/API, pushing

        ranked candidates forward.


   - Cost-optimized Al evaluation for seasonal hiring in hospitality/BPO.


The AI/ML approach relies on LLMs for contextual understanding and recommendation

engines developed in partnership with Pure Billion Technologies, including robust data

pipelines for cleaning scraped or uploaded data. While innovative, its early-stage maturity

(founded 2023) suggests risks like limited AP! documentation and potential reliance on

partner support for roadmap velocity. Overall, Sourcio democratizes advanced Al for

recruitment but requires pilots to validate accuracy against human judgment. (Word count:

SECTION 2: COMPANY SIZE & REGIONAL FIT

Ideal Company Sizes (select ALL that apply - CSV format):

   .     1-50 employees


   .     51-200 employees

   -     201-500 employees


   O 500+ employees
Evidence for each:


   - 1-50: Pricing tiers like Starter (60 CVs/mo) suggest fit for small teams.


   - 51-200: Growth plan (500 CVs/mo) aligns with mid-sized hiring volumes.

   - 201-500: Pro plan (1,500 CVs/mo) supports higher volumes, but case studies imply

       mid-market.


   - 500+: Not explicitly supported; enterprise features like custom APIs are beta or

       unconfirmed.


Company Size Notes (100 words max): Pricing and features target SMBs and mid-market

agencies with caps on CVs/jobs (e.g., Pro: 1,500 CVs/10 jobs). Case studies focus on high-

volume but low-complexity roles in Retail/BPO, suggesting 50-500 employees sweet spot.

No explicit large enterprise mentions; lacks HCM features like payroll.
