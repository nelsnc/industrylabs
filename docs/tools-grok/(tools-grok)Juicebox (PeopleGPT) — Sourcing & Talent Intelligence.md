Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered recruiting platform for

talent search, CRM, and automated agents.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Juicebox (PeopleGPT) is an Al-driven recruiting platform designed to streamline talent

acquisition by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for semantic search, candidate

engagement, and workflow automation. Founded in 2022 by David Paffenholz and Ishan

Gupta as part of Y Combinator's Summer 2022 cohort, the company pivoted from

consumer applications to address inefficiencies in enterprise recruitment. The core

product, PeopleGPT, aggregates data from over 800 million public profiles across 30+

sources, including LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow, Google Scholar, and AngelList, to

create enriched "Smart Profiles" that infer skills and experiences beyond explicit keywords.


The platform's "Method" involves two steps: Al-generated filter creation from natural

language queries (e.g., "Machine Learning Engineers in San Francisco with LLM research

from top Al labs") and autonomic evaluation via Al agents. This enables discovery of

passive "hidden" talent through contextual understanding, such as inferring React

expertise for frontend roles or leadership from project contributions. Key differentiators

include agentic Al for 24/7 background processing, reinforcement learning from recruiter

feedback to refine searches, and multi-agent concurrency for parallel workflows.

Target users span high-growth tech companies (e.g., Perplexity, Ramp), staffing agencies,

and enterprises augmenting ATS like Greenhouse or Workday. Ideal buyers are recruiters

handling specialized roles in competitive markets, where traditional Boolean searches fail.

Main use cases include: outbound sourcing for niche skills, market intelligence on

competitor talent pools, diversity analytics, and automated outreach with hyper-

personalized emails (up to 3x higher response rates). The Al/ML approach uses LLMs for

query parsing, entity resolution, and personalization, with safeguards against third-party

model training on customer data.


Juicebox positions itself as an "Open Web" alternative to closed ecosystems like LinkedIn,

emphasizing data freshness from constant crawling and bi-directional ATS integrations for

duplicate detection and job imports. With $36M in funding led by Sequoia, the company

serves 2,500+ customers, powering thousands of daily searches. Adoption stories

highlight ROI, such as 50% reduced sourcing time and roles filled in under 3 weeks. As

recruitment shifts to strategic intelligence, Juicebox leads the agentic era, decoupling

capacity from human hours while maintaining ethical data practices. (Word count: 512)
