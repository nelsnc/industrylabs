Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered interview intelligence for

structured hiring and insights.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): BrightHire is an interview

intelligence platform that transforms hiring by leveraging Al to capture, analyze, and

optimize interview conversations. Founded in 2019 and acquired by Zoom in November

2025, it addresses the "black box" of interviews by providing structured plans, automated

screening, real-time guidance, evidence-based decisions, and performance insights. Core

modules include: Plan (Al-generated job descriptions and interview kits), Screen

(autonomous Al interviewer for preliminary voice-based screens), Interview (recording,

transcription, Al notes, and guides integrated with video tools), Decide (candidate

summaries and comparisons), and Improve (analytics and coaching). It ensures compliance

and bias mitigation, integrating seamlessly with ATS like Greenhouse and Workday. Post-

acquisition, BrightHire operates as a standalone brand within Zoom, enhancing Zoom

Workplace with Al for hiring while maintaining cross-platform compatibility. Key

differentiators: Links automated screens to live interviews in a continuous data thread,

offers "game tape" playback for debriefs, and provides 27% fewer interviews per hire per

studies. Targets mid-market to enterprise talent teams in HR, focusing on recruiters and

hiring managers who interview sporadically. Al approach: Uses LLMs for note-taking and

NLP for real-time analysis, trained on millions of interviews without using customer data for

external models. Use cases: Structured interviewing to reduce bias, scaling screening to

eliminate false negatives (only 1in 10 applicants screened manually), accelerating decisions

with evidence clips, and coaching interviewers via insights. Verified outcomes from

customers like Salesloft (40% faster recruiter ramp) and Angi (300% hire increase). As part

of Zoom, future synergies include multi-lingual screening and predictive analytics from

vast meeting data. Overall, it shifts hiring from subjective to objective, improving speed,

quality, and fairness. (Word count: 312 — expand as needed for Premium).

Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 1), integration quality (mostly Native), funding

details, G2 actual rating.

   - Implementation timeline (estimated, no official)

   - HIPAA compliance (not explicit)


   - Free trial duration (yes, but unknown length)


RESEARCH QUALITY NOTES: Official pricing gated; used aggregate data. Acquisition

recent (Nov 2025), may impact future pricing/compliance. No ISO 27001 found.

Conservative on unknowns like setup fees.
