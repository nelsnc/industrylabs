SECTION 1: BASIC INFORMATION

Tool Name (exact spelling): Brev.io

Company Legal Name: Brev. Technologies, Inc.

Website URL: https://brev.io/

Logo URL: Manual download needed

Primary Category (select ONE):


   -“’   Performance Management
Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered OS for autonomous goal

tracking and business execution.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Brev.io is a business performance

operating system that leverages Al agents to automate goal management, OKRs, KPIs, and

business rhythms without manual input. Founded by former Ally.io executives (acquired by

Microsoft), it addresses "progress blindness" by integrating with tools to monitor data

streams, detect risks, and generate actionable insights. Core functionality includes Al-

drafted check-ins, automated pre-reads for meetings, and a "Company Memory" for

contextual coaching. It supports frameworks like OKRs and EOS, with agents that analyze

structured/unstructured data for recommendations. Differentiators: Agentic workflows

(proactive vs passive tracking), LLM-native integrations for nuanced understanding, and

focus on execution over administration. Target users: Mid-market teams (engineering,

sales, product) in tech-savvy organizations seeking async alignment. Ideal buyer: CXOs or

managers in remote/hybrid setups frustrated with stale reporting. Main use cases: Weekly

business reviews (auto-generated agendas), goal alignment (strategy maps), risk detection

(velocity drops, blockers), and performance coaching (retrospectives). Al/ML approach:

Uses LLMs for natural language drafting, RAG for company context, and time-series

analysis for forecasting. Scalable for growing teams, emphasizing zero-overhead adoption.

(Word count: 248 - expand as needed for Premium).

Key Features (5-8 bullet points - for CSV-ready):

   1.   Al-Copilot Coach for goal drafting and recommendations.


   2. Native LLM integrations for auto-tracking progress.
