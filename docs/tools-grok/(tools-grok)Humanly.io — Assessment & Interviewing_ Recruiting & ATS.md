Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered conversational recruiting

and interview automation for high-volume hiring.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Humanly.io represents a significant evolution in the landscape of Talent Acquisition (TA)

technology, positioning itself not merely as a tool for automation but as a comprehensive

Al-driven recruiting platform and Talent CRM designed to fundamentally restructure how

organizations handle high-volume hiring. In an industry often plagued by disjointed point

solutions, Humanly has engineered a unified ecosystem that bridges the critical gap

between initial candidate interest and the final hiring decision. Unlike traditional Applicant

Tracking Systems (ATS), which often function primarily as static repositories of data—

systems of record rather than systems of engagement—Humanly operates as an intelligent,

active engagement layer that sits atop existing HR technology stacks. Its architectural

philosophy is built around the concept of "Al that Elevates," focusing on amplifying human

potential rather than replacing it, a distinction that is increasingly critical in a market

sensitive to the ethical implications of automation.
The platform’s core functionality addresses the most resource-intensive segment of the

recruitment funnel: the top-of-funnel activities comprising candidate screening,

scheduling, and initial interviewing. At the heart of this capability is a sophisticated

Conversational Al—frequently described by users and the vendor as an "Al Recruiter"—that

engages candidates instantly across multiple channels, including web chat, SMS, and

email. This is a departure from first-generation scripted chatbots that relied on rigid

decision trees; Humanly’s technology utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)

to conduct "two-way conversations." This capability allows the system to analyze

candidate intent, sentiment, and specific qualifications in real-time. By doing so, Humanly

effectively screens candidates against specific, customizable job requirements 24 hours a

day, 7 days a week, ensuring that no applicant enters the proverbial "black hole" of

recruitment—a major pain point for candidate experience in high-volume industries.


A key differentiator for Humanly is its strategic expansion beyond simple text-based

interaction into the realm of structured digital interviews and autonomous scoring. While

market competitors like Paradox have historically focused heavily on enterprise-wide chat

automation and logistics, Humanly has carved out a niche by emphasizing the quality and

fairness of the interview itself. The platform’s "Al Interviewer" capability can conduct initial

screening interviews autonomously, generating structured scorecards and insights. This

methodology is designed to reduce unconscious bias by standardizing the evaluation

criteria for every candidate, ensuring that hiring decisions are based on data and

competency rather than subjective "gut feeling". This focus on validity and fairness is

underpinned by rigorous third-party audits (such as those by FairNow), positioning

Humanly as a leader in ethical Al compliance—a critical factor for mid-market and

enterprise companies navigating new regulations like NYC’s Local Law 144.
Furthermore, the platform's utility extends into the post-application phase through its

Talent CRM. This component is essential for modern recruitment strategies that prioritize

"rediscovery"—the ability to mine an organization's existing database for silver-medalist

candidates who match new job openings. By automating the re-engagement of these pre-

qualified candidates, Humanly helps organizations significantly reduce their reliance on

paid job board advertising, driving down the overall Cost Per Hire (CPH). The May 2024

acquisition of Teamable further bolstered this capability, integrating deep employee referral

and social sourcing functionalities directly into the platform, thereby transforming Humanly

from a screening tool into a full-cycle sourcing and engagement powerhouse.


Key Features (5-8 bullet points - CSV-ready):

   1.   Conversational Al Chatbot: 24/7 candidate engagement via SMS, Web, and

        WhatsApp to screen and schedule instantly. Uses NLP to understand intent, not just

        keywords.


   2. Automated Reference Checking: Al-driven collection of reference feedback. This

        automates the chase for references, speeding up offer generation.

   3. Virtual Interview Assistant ("Humanly Voice"): Records, transcribes, and analyzes live

        interviews (Zoom/Teams) for bias and sentiment. This provides "interview

        intelligence" to help train recruiters and ensure fairness.


   4. Candidate Rediscovery: "Talent CRM" features that mine existing ATS databases to

        resurface silver-medalist candidates for new roles, maximizing the value of past

        applicants.


   5. Smart Scheduling: Automated calendar coordination for complex interview panels,

        syncing with recruiter availability to reduce admin time.


   6. Diversity & Bias Analytics: Dashboards monitoring funnel pass-through rates by

        demographic to flag potential bias in the hiring process, ensuring compliance with

        DEI goals.


   7. Teamable Sourcing: Integrated employee referral and social sourcing engine

        (following acquisition).

SECTION 2: COMPANY SIZE & REGIONAL FIT

Ideal Company Sizes (select ALL that apply - CSV format):

   -       “1-50 employees


   -“’     51-200 employees


   -       201-500 employees


   -“’     500+ employees


Evidence for each:


   - 1-50: Reviews indicate active usage by small businesses. "Small-Business (50 or fewer

         emp.)" users have explicitly left reviews on G2.

   - 51-200: "Mid-Market (51-1000 emp.)" is a dominant category in G2 reviews. The tool

         is frequently positioned as a "mid-market friendly" alternative.


   - 201-500: Case studies feature companies like TheKey (thousands of caregivers) and

         Moss Adams (a significant mid-market/enterprise accounting firm).

   - 500+: Explicitly targets "mid-market and enterprise teams" with large-scale

         customers like Microsoft, Worldwide Flight Services.


Company Size Notes (100 words max): Analysis of marketing materials, pricing structures,

and third-party reviews suggests the sweet spot is the Mid-Market (200-1,000

employees). While capable of serving enterprise clients (e.g., Microsoft, Noom), Humanly is

cited as a more accessible alternative to Paradox for mid-sized organizations. Pricing

based on "stream slots" (active roles) is advantageous for consistent high-volume hiring in

specific departments.
