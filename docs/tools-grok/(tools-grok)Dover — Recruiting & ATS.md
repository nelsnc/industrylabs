 Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Free ATS with Al sourcing for

 startup recruiting.

 Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium): Dover, operated by Staya, Inc., is a

 recruiting operating system tailored for startups and high-growth companies,

 combining a free Applicant Tracking System (ATS) with Al-driven sourcing and a

 marketplace for fractional recruiters. The platform addresses key pain points in talent

 acquisition, such as manual sourcing, high agency fees, and fragmented workflows, by

 automating top-of-funnel activities and providing on-demand human expertise. Core

 functionality includes unlimited job postings, users, and candidates in the ATS, Al-

 generated careers pages, one-click distribution to 50+ job boards, and automated

 resume scoring using Large Language Models (LLMs) to rank applicants. The Sourcing

 Autopilot feature identifies passive candidates from platforms like LinkedIn and

 GitHub, sends personalized outreach emails, and schedules interviews via Google

 Calendar integration, learning from user feedback to refine matches over time. The

 Recruiting Partners Marketplace connects users with vetted recruiters on an hourly

 basis ($80-$150/hr), who work embedded in the client's Dover instance and Slack

 channels for transparency. Key differentiators include its "freemium" model that

 commoditizes basic ATS features, deep Slack integration for in-flow approvals, and a

 focus on startup velocity—setup in minutes without complex configurations. Unlike

 enterprise tools like Greenhouse or Lever, Dover emphasizes simplicity and cost-

 efficiency, avoiding feature bloat while supporting bi-directional syncs with those

 systems for hybrid use. Target users are founders, hiring managers, and lean HR teams

 in tech startups (Seed to Series C), particularly those using Google Workspace and

 Slack, who need to scale hiring without full-time recruiters. Main use cases include

 rapid engineering and sales team expansion, where Al handles 80% of sourcing to

 reduce time-to-hire from 45-60 days to under 30, employee referral programs for

 internal sourcing, and agency management for burst hiring needs. The Al/ML

 approach leverages proprietary datasets for candidate matching and personalization,

 with iterative calibration to minimize bias and improve accuracy. Trusted by over 600

 companies, including Vanta and Regal.io, Dover enables cost savings of 50-70% on

 recruiting fees while maintaining high-quality pipelines. However, it may not suit large

 enterprises requiring advanced permissions or Microsoft ecosystem integrations.
       Overall, Dover democratizes recruiting by treating it as an orchestrated supply chain,

       blending software automation with fractional services for efficient, scalable hiring. (512

-      “1-50 employees


-      “51-200 employees


-’     201-500 employees


O 500+ employees
     Evidence for each:


- 1-50: Pricing and focus on startups from Seed stage; case studies like early Vanta (1 to

     40 employees)


- 51-200: Common in customer stories, e.g., Regal.io scaled from 30 to 85; sweet spot

     for fractional services


- 201-500: Supported in some cases, but less emphasis; larger startups up to Series C

- 500+: Not primary; enterprise features limited per reviews

     Company Size Notes (100 words max): Targets startups from Seed to Series C, ideal

     for 1-200 employees based on pricing (free ATS, affordable marketplace). Case

     studies show scaling to 85-200+ but not enterprise-level. Reviews note it's great for

     fast-growing startups but may lack depth for 500+.
