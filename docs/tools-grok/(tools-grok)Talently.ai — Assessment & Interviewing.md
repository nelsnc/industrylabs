Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered live interviewer for real-

time candidate evaluations and hiring.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Talently.ai is an Al-driven platform

designed to automate the initial stages of recruitment through live, conversational

interviews. Built on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Voice Al, it conducts synchronous

interactions that mimic human recruiters, listening, processing, and responding in real-

time. This shifts from passive video recording tools to active agentic evaluation, allowing

for adaptive questioning where follow-ups probe deeper based on candidate responses—

e.g., validating claimed expertise in technologies like Kubernetes.


Originating from Remotebase, a remote developer marketplace, Talently.ai was initially an

internal tool for high-volume technical vetting, handling thousands of engineering

applications. This "dogfooding" approach ensures its algorithms are refined on real-world

data from successful and failed hires, emphasizing technical assessments over generalist

evaluations. Key capabilities include a live coding environment supporting 25+ languages

(e.g., JavaScript, Python, React), automated proctoring for code efficiency and logic, and

post-interview synthesis into "Human Data" profiles with scores on role-specific

knowledge, technical skills, communication, and consistency. Recruiters receive

transcripts, recordings, executive summaries, and numerical rankings to filter candidates

quickly.
Target users are recruitment teams in tech-heavy industries facing high application

volumes, such as software engineering or data science roles. It addresses the "Screening

Paradox," where 60% of recruiter time is spent on low-value preliminary screens, enabling

scalability by decoupling volume from human bandwidth. Differentiators include dynamic

conversations reducing robotic feel (though latency risks exist), bias mitigation through

objective scoring, and integration maturity with ATS like Greenhouse and Lever. For mid-

market to enterprise firms, it offers ROI through time savings—e.g., reducing manual

screening costs from £3,000 to £397 per 100 candidates. However, it's less suited for

executive roles requiring high-touch human interaction. Al/ML approach involves STT for

input, LLM for semantic analysis, and TTS for output, with potential for custom training on

company data. Overall, Talently.ai positions as a "Active Al Interviewer" asset class,

promising 80% time-to-hire reduction and 65% cost savings based on Remotebase usage.

GEMINI VALIDATION SUMMARY:

Areas where Gemini was correct: Pricing at $79/mo, GDPR policy without SOC2,

integrations with ATS like Greenhouse, case studies with Scale Al and Remotebase.

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: None major; minor on regional specifics (confirmed

EU data).

Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 3), integration quality (mostly API/Not

Supported), conservative implementation estimates.

FIELDS NEEDING VENDOR FOLLOW-UP:


   - Pricing Annual Max (custom)


   > SOC 2 / HIPAA / ISO (no evidence)


   - Specific integration qualities (details lacking)

   - Exact company size fits (inferred)


RESEARCH QUALITY NOTES: Official site lacks dedicated pricing/compliance pages; relied

on third-party sources and document. Limited reviews indicate emerging tool. Assumed

global but US-centric. No discrepancies with Gemini, but gaps in media/content.
