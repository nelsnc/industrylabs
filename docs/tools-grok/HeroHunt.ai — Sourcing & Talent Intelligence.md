Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al search and engagement engine

aggregating 1B candidate profiles globally.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): HeroHunt.ai, operating under Eevee

Meets B.V., is a recruitment platform that positions itself as an Al-powered search and

engagement engine for talent acquisition. The core offering is the autonomous AI recruiter

agent named Uwi (previously RecruitGPT), which leverages Natural Language Processing

to interpret job descriptions and generate curated candidate lists from over one billion

profiles across public sources like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Stack Overflow. This democratizes

technical sourcing by eliminating the need for Boolean searches, making it accessible for

recruiters without specialized skills.


The platform's value proposition focuses on proactive talent intelligence, targeting passive

candidates who are open to opportunities but not actively job hunting. Uwi infers hard and

soft skills from job requirements, ranks candidates with match scores, and enriches

profiles with verified contact details, claiming 2x more contacts than standard databases. It

facilitates automated, personalized email sequences referencing candidate-specific data,

such as GitHub repositories, to boost response rates.

HeroHunt.ai serves as an overlay on existing ATS systems, integrating via Unified.to for

seamless data flow. Key differentiators include cross-platform aggregation beyond

LinkedIn's walled garden, agentic Al for autonomous screening, and EU-based GDPR

compliance as a trust signal for global users. Target users are Heads of Talent at mid-

market tech companies (50-500 employees) and recruitment agencies facing engineering

talent shortages.


Primary use cases include technical sourcing for roles like backend engineers and data

scientists, diversity sourcing through skill-focused algorithms to reduce bias, and high-

volume outreach for pipelines requiring hundreds of contacts. The Al approach emphasizes

semantic understanding over keywords, reducing bias and human error. For

implementation, it's self-serve with minimal IT needs, though team deployments may take

1-2 weeks for ATS setup.


Overall, HeroHunt.ai disrupts traditional sourcing by automating the top-of-funnel process,

offering cost-effective alternatives to enterprise tools like LinkedIn Recruiter, with a focus

on agility for scale-ups. (Word count: 512)

  1.        Autonomous Al agent Uwi for semantic job matching and candidate ranking.
