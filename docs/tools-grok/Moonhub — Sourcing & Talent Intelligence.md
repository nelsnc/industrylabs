Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al recruiter with agents for sourcing,

engaging, and monitoring talent globally.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Moonhub, founded in 2022 by Nancy Xu, revolutionized recruitment with its Al Recruiter

platform, shifting from traditional database searches to autonomous agentic workflows.

The system featured three core agents: Qualify Al for semantic sourcing across billions of

data points from LinkedIn, GitHub, Google Scholar, and the open web; Engage Al for hyper-

personalized multichannel outreach with high response rates; and Monitor Al for intent

analysis and human handoffs. This architecture addressed key pain points like the Boolean

bottleneck, passive candidate access, and application noise, achieving 50% faster time-

to-hire, 80% interview conversion, and 5x more candidates than manual methods.

Moonhub's proprietary knowledge graph enabled discovery of "hidden" talent, with 75% of

presented candidates being new to clients. The "Service-as-Software" model combined Al

with top 1% talent partners, offering outcomes like filled calendars with vetted candidates

at costs 75% below agencies. Pricing included contingency fees (15-25% of salary) for

sporadic hires and custom subscriptions for ongoing needs. Integrations with ATS like

Greenhouse and Lever ensured seamless workflows, while global EOR capabilities

supported international hiring. Clients ranged from Omneky (hired 3 engineers in 3

months) to Activeloop (senior fullstack in 1 week). Ethical Al focused on skills over pedigree

to reduce bias, with sensitive data handling for DE&l compliance. In June 2025, Salesforce

acqui-hired the team for Agentforce, winding down standalone operations, signaling

validation of agentic Al in HR. Moonhub's legacy persists in reshaping enterprise talent

acquisition through autonomous systems. (Word count: 528)
