Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered recruiting assistant for

high-volume hiring via conversational interfaces.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Talentropy.ai is an Al-native platform designed to overlay existing HR systems, automating

recruitment workflows without replacing core tools like ATS or CRM. Founded in 2019 and

backed by Y Combinator (W22), the company focuses on high-volume, operational hiring in

LATAM markets, expanding from Colombia to Mexico. The suite includes three

interoperable products: Aria, a conversational recruiting agent; Prospect.ai, a natural

language sourcing tool; and TalentRate, a real-time salary benchmarking engine.

Aria acts as an autonomous assistant, handling candidate engagement through chat

interfaces like WhatsApp, reducing application abandonment by enabling natural language

responses. It standardizes resumes from unstructured data, performs semantic searches

on existing ATS databases to rediscover past talent, and automates scheduling with

calendar syncs. This feature is particularly suited for mobile-first regions where email

response rates are low, boasting 30% faster time-to-hire and higher show-up rates via

reminders.


Prospect.ai simplifies outbound sourcing by translating natural language queries (e.g.,

"Senior backend developer in Mexico City with AWS experience") into searches across

public profiles from LinkedIn, GitHub, and open sources. It delivers results in card format

with details like experience, education, and contacts, ensuring compliance by using only

public data. This tool saves hours on manual Boolean searches, focusing recruiters on

engagement.


TalentRate provides instant market intelligence, aggregating data from Glassdoor, LinkedIn,

and Numbeo to compare salaries, labor demand, and cost of living across geographies. It

generates reports in under 60 seconds, 90% faster than traditional methods, aiding global

mobility and remote hiring strategies with defensible data for negotiations.
The platform's "overlay architecture" integrates bi-directionally with ATS (e.g., Lever,

Ashby), Slack, WhatsApp, and documents via APIs, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation

(RAG) to answer candidate queries from internal manuals accurately. Targeted at mid-

market to enterprise companies in high-volume sectors like retail and BPO, it emphasizes

no-code workflows for agility. With a focus on LATAM (40% sales in Mexico), it supports

multilingual interactions and complies with US privacy laws (CCPA, CPRA), though GDPR

details are limited. Key differentiators include WhatsApp dominance for emerging markets

and asset recovery from existing databases. Social proof includes case studies with

Tiendas Ara (reduced training time) and TP México (faster proposals). Overall, Talentropy.ai

democratizes recruitment for low-skilled roles, prioritizing efficiency and data-driven

decisions. (512 words)
