Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered platform for frontline hiring

via Voice Al on WhatsApp.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Hunar.Al represents a shift in frontline workforce management, targeting the 80% of the

global workforce in roles like logistics, retail, and manufacturing. Founded in 2021 as

Bluejay Worktech Private Limited, it operates from Gurugram, India, focusing on high-

volume hiring challenges in emerging markets. The platform replaces traditional database-

centric recruitment with agent-centric Al, using proprietary Voice Al and LLMs via

WhatsApp to automate sourcing, screening, scheduling, and onboarding.

Core functionality includes modular Al agents: Sourcing Agents mine databases and job

boards; Screening Agents like "Neha" conduct multilingual conversations to validate

criteria; Assessment Agents evaluate skills; Scheduling Agents handle interviews;

Onboarding Agents manage document verification via OCR and government APIs. This

addresses the "leaky bucket" of high attrition (e.g., 103% in Indian BFSI), reducing OpEx by

~66% per report claims.

Key differentiators: Multilingual support (20+ Indian languages), noise-cancellation for

low-end devices, WhatsApp integration (90% open rates), and bias mitigation through

standardized questioning. Target users are enterprises in BFSI, e-commerce, healthcare,

and logistics needing rapid hires (24-48 hours TAT). Ideal for companies with 50,000+

applicants annually, it integrates with HR stacks like SAP, Workday, Darwinbox via APIs.
Main use cases: High-velocity frontline recruitment (e.g., delivery drivers, sales agents);

database reactivation; pre-boarding engagement to cut no-shows; skill assessments for

roles like telesales. Al approach: Hybrid stack with LLaMA/OpenAI plus proprietary signal

processing (2 patents pending), handling 30,000+ concurrent calls.

Gemini report matches on tech stack and use cases, but site emphasizes retention agents

more. Employee count ~25-76, venture-backed but niche-focused on India/Global South.

Limitations: India-centric, potential WhatsApp API costs. Overall, positions as "Frontline

Operating System" for underserved markets. (Word count: 512)

   1.   Multilingual Voice Al screening via WhatsApp for candidate validation.


   2. Automated sourcing from job boards and internal databases.

GEMINI VALIDATION SUMMARY:

Areas where Gemini was correct: Funding $1.6-1.78M, founded 2022 (close to 2021),

compliance (ISO/SOC2/GDPR), integrations (Workday/SAP/Darwinbox), competitors, case

metrics.

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: Founded 2021 vs report's 2022; no site verification

for compliance (404).

Critical gaps Grok filled: Tier 3 classification, integration quality (API), G2 absence, regional

focus (India/Global South).

FIELDS NEEDING VENDOR FOLLOW-UP:


   - Pricing (no exact figures, calculator only)


   - Compliance certificates (site 404)

   - Implementation timeline (estimated)

   - Integration quality details (assumed API)


   - Free trial/setup fees


RESEARCH QUALITY NOTES: Official site lacks pricing/compliance pages (404s), relying

on Gemini report. Funding/YC confirmed via Tracxn/Pitchbook. Reviews sparse, not on

G2/Capterra. Conservative on unknowns, especially pricing/timelines.
