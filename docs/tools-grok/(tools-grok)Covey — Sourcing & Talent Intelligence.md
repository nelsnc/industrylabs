Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-native platform for sourcing and

screening talent with human-level nuance.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Covey represents a shift in talent

acquisition from traditional keyword-based systems to Al-native cognitive automation.

Founded in 2018, Covey, Inc. is headquartered in San Francisco, CA, with a focus on high-

growth startups and enterprises. The platform's core thesis is to replicate human recruiter

intuition using Generative Al and Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle the volume

crisis in recruiting.


Unlike legacy ATS systems that create data swamps with manual boolean searches, Covey

employs semantic analysis to understand context and intent. For example, it can identify a

"Backend Engineer" with Python skills even if the keyword is absent. The "Glass Box"

philosophy ensures transparency, providing explanations for candidate rankings and

allowing human feedback via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to

refine models.


The product suite includes Scout Inbound for screening thousands of applications

instantly, identifying the top 5% based on plain-language criteria. Scout Outbound targets

passive talent across sources like LinkedIn, GitHub, and employee networks for warm

introductions. The CRM layer handles email discovery (95% accuracy), drip campaigns,

and generative personalization referencing profile details. Analytics track funnel metrics

and DEI pipeline composition.


Integrations are deep with ATS like Greenhouse, Lever, and Ashby, using APIs for bi-

directional sync. The Chrome extension enables one-click sourcing from the web with

duplicate detection. Pricing is hybrid: CRM at $125-$150/user/month, Scout usage-based,

making it 4x more cost-effective than competitors like Gem.


Case studies show impact: Sendoso reduced time-to-fill by 45% and cost-per-hire by

70%; Deel scaled hiring 10x for global expansion; ScorePlay filled 5 roles in 3 months

without additional headcount. Compliance includes NYC Local Law 144 bias audits, GDPR

with DPA and SCCs, and inferred SOC 2 from enterprise clients, though not explicitly

certified on site. Security features AES-256 encryption and annual penetration testing.
Covey's Al-native architecture differentiates it from Al-enabled tools, targeting innovative

TA leaders frustrated by administrative burdens. It unbundles recruiting, automating

sourcing to free humans for relationships. In a market with Gem (CRM-focused), SeekOut

(search engine), and Dover (autopilot), Covey excels in nuanced matching and integrated

outreach at lower cost. As Al matures, Covey positions to challenge incumbents in human

capital management. (512 words)

Implementation Prerequisites (100 words max): ATS like Greenhouse/Lever for sync;

defined role criteria; recruiter access to LinkedIn/GitHub; SSO if enterprise; project lead for

SECTION 9: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

Primary Competitors (2-3 tools):


   1.    Gem - CRM & Analytics

Key Differentiator (100 words max): Al-native with generative matching vs keyword tools;

"Glass Box" transparency reduces bias. Lower pricing (4x cheaper than Gem) with

integrated sourcing/CRM. Focus on nuance and RLHF for custom intuition, unlike
