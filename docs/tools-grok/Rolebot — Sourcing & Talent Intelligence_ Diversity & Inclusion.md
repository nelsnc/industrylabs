Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered sourcing with human

verification for passive talent and diversity.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Rolebot, now fully integrated into Visage following the August 2025 merger, represents a

hybrid Al-human recruiting platform focused on passive talent sourcing and diversity

inclusion. The core functionality reverses traditional recruitment by using "look-alike" Al

matching: recruiters upload ideal employee profiles, and the system analyzes over 100 data

points (career trajectory, education, digital footprints like GitHub or patents) to identify

similar passive candidates across the open web. This avoids keyword-based flaws,

reducing bias and surfacing hidden talent.

Post-merger, Visage's network of over 4,000 vetted global sourcers adds a human-in-the-

loop layer for verification, assessing soft skills, cultural fit, and nuances Al misses. The

platform includes autonomous engagement with personalized, multi-channel outreach

sequences optimized for response rates. A key differentiator is the "Diversity by Default"

guarantee, ensuring at least 33% of candidates from underrepresented groups in every

batch, embedded in the algorithm to meet DEI goals systematically.
Target users are mid-market HR leaders (50-500 employees) with high-volume or

specialized hiring needs but limited internal capacity. It acts as a force multiplier,

integrating atop existing ATS without replacement. The Ul mimics "Tinder for Recruiting"

with thumbs-up/down feedback to refine Al models in real-time. Technological

underpinnings include NLP for unstructured data parsing and predictive analytics for

candidate "move-ability" scores.


In a crowded market, Visage/Rolebot stands out with contextual Al over keywords, human

calibration reducing rejection rates, and structural diversity engineering. It targets

organizations lacking big-brand pull but needing efficient pipelines, with features like

pipeline analytics for hire forecasting. The merger enhances scalability, serving enterprises

like Siemens and Ford via SOC 2 compliance and integrations with major ATS. Overall, it

bridges high-cost RPO and low-quality automations, promising "Sourcing on Autopilot"

with verifiable quality. (Word count: 512)
