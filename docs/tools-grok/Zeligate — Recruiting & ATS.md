Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered platform automating 60%

of recruitment with agentic Al workers.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Zeligate is an Australian-based Al

platform revolutionizing recruitment by deploying "Zeli" Al agents as digital co-workers.

Founded in 2023, it targets the administrative crisis in hiring, where recruiters soend 60%

of time on non-strategic tasks like resume screening and scheduling. Zeligate's vertical Al

approach pre-trains models on recruitment ontologies, enabling autonomous workflows

without constant human input. Core product Recruiter Zeli handles top-of-funnel

processes: semantic sourcing, intelligent ranking (contextual skill analysis over keywords),

autonomous video interviewing (with avatars, transcripts, and sentiment reports), and

automated reference/verification. This shifts recruiters from processors to decision-

makers, saving 20-47 hours per hire. PA Zeli offers broader utility like meeting intelligence

and research, while CS Zeli monitors sentiment for extensibility. Key differentiators include

bias mitigation via blind scoring, a   "Pay-Per-Job" model aligning costs with activity, and no-

code setup. Ideal for mid-market to enterprise firms with high-volume hiring, it integrates

with ATS like Greenhouse and Lever. Al/ML leverages multi-LLM architecture for resilience,

hosted on AWS with GDPR adherence. Users delegate objectives (e.g., "Screen 100

applicants"), and Zeli executes asynchronously. Adoption suits teams resistant to complex

tools, with anthropomorphic design reducing cognitive load. Risks include seed-stage

volatility and self-attested SOC 2. Overall, Zeligate embodies "Al that works - humans that

lead," decoupling hiring scale from headcount. (312 words; expand with specifics if needed

for 500+).

Key Features (5-8 bullet points - CSV-ready):
  1.    Semantic resume screening and intelligent ranking with bias mitigation.


  2. Autonomous video/phone interviews with transcripts and highlight reels.


        Automated reference checks and identity/work rights verification.

(minor range diff).


Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 1), integration quality (Native
