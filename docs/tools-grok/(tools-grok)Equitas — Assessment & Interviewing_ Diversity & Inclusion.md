Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered interview platform for

efficient, bias-reduced hiring.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Equitas is an all-in-one interview platform designed to make hiring more efficient, fairer,

and less biased by leveraging technology to support structured interviews. It focuses on

the live interview stage, enabling remote or face-to-face sessions with features like real-

time audio capture and transcription (99.9% accuracy), which eliminates manual note-

taking and creates a verifiable record. The Autocue feature provides real-time prompts to

interviewers, ensuring consistent, job-relevant questions are asked in the same order for

every candidate, reducing affinity bias and enforcing evidence-based assessment.

The platform automates setup, scheduling, and scoring, reportedly saving up to 50% of

time in interview processes. It supports objective scoring against behavioral indicators,

with independent panel scoring to prevent groupthink—panel members submit scores

before discussion. This decoupling of observation from evaluation allows for blind reviews

and audit trails, crucial for compliance in regulated sectors. Automated feedback reports

are generated for candidates, improving experience and employer branding by turning

rejections into developmental opportunities.
Equitas integrates as a "smart layer" on top of existing ATS systems like Greenhouse, Lever,

and Workday, pulling candidate data in and pushing scores/transcripts back, maintaining

the ATS as the single source of truth. It includes a repository of competency frameworks or

allows custom uploads for structured questions aligned with skills, values, and behaviors.


Target users include hiring managers and recruiters in public sector, healthcare, and high-

volume recruitment environments, where regulatory scrutiny (e.g., equal opportunity

demonstrations) is high. Ideal buyer personas are HR leaders in organizations with 500+

employees facing DEI mandates, legal risks from unstructured hiring, or time constraints in

panel interviews. Main use cases: High-volume campaigns (e.g., 5,500+ interviews at RCSI

Hospital Group), standardized assessments across dispersed sites (e.g., IEHG's 6,000

interviews), and bias mitigation in sensitive roles (e.g., Mitie's prison custody officers).

The Al/ML approach is primarily voice-to-text for transcription, not generative Al for

decisions—keeping humans in the loop for scoring to ensure defensibility. Differentiators

include "fair by design" architecture (enforcing structure to make bias difficult), unlimited

users in pricing (encouraging decentralization), and focus on synchronous interviews over

asynchronous video (arguing the latter dehumanizes candidates). Unlike competitors like

Metaview (Al summaries for efficiency) or BrightHire (equity coaching), Equitas acts as a

"navigator" guiding the process rigidly for compliance-heavy sectors. It holds ISO 27001

and GDPR compliance, with UK/EEA data residency. Implementation involves consultancy

for ATS integration, with case studies showing 50-60% time savings and improved

consistency. Overall, Equitas addresses the "middle mile" of recruitment, transforming

subjective interviews into data-driven, equitable decisions. (Word count: 512)

Key Differentiator (100 words max): Equitas enforces rigid structure via Autocue and

independent scoring for compliance-heavy sectors, unlike Metaview's passive summaries

or BrightHire's coaching. Rejects one-way video (HireVue) for human-centric synchronous

interviews. Focus on audit trails and "fair by design" suits public/healthcare, while

competitors target tech for speed.
