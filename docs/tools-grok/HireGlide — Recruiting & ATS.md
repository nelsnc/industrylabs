Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al screening tool that ranks resumes

and conducts adaptive interviews for hiring teams.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

HireGlide is a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2025, part of Y Combinator's Fall

2025 batch. It addresses the modern recruitment challenge where application volume has

exploded due to easy-apply features and Al-generated resumes, creating overwhelming

noise for recruiters. Traditional ATS systems like Greenhouse and Lever act as passive

repositories, but HireGlide introduces an Al-native layer for screening and matching.

The platform operates on a dual model: a B2B employer tool for automated screening and a

B2C mobile app for candidates, particularly early-career "freshers." For employers, it

integrates atop existing ATS via CSV uploads or API (e.g., with Ashby), using semantic

analysis to score resumes against job descriptions via vector embeddings and cosine

similarity, reducing false positives from keyword stuffing and false negatives from varied

terminology. It provides "Glass Box" explainability, offering natural language justifications

for scores to build trust and mitigate algorithm aversion.
High-scoring candidates advance to adaptive Al interviews (3-15 minutes), which

dynamically probe claims (e.g., follow-ups on technical skills) to verify substance, making it

harder to game with fabricated resumes. This digitizes phone screens at scale, with

consistency free from human bias or fatigue. HireGlide is building a pre-assessed talent

network, recycling anonymized candidate data across employers to create a shared

marketplace, potentially shifting hiring from inbound pulls to proactive pushes.


Target users are high-growth tech startups (e.g., YC companies) dealing with high-volume

inbound for entry-level roles. It focuses on the "fresher" market—students and recent

graduates—with undifferentiated resumes and high application spray. The B2C app enables

One-tap applies (up to 20 jobs every 20 minutes), ATS-optimized resumes, and Al career

counseling via conversational discovery of skills and interests. This feeds quality data back

to employers, creating a feedback loop.

Key differentiators include its agentic approach (Al agents interacting with candidate Al

agents), emphasis on explainable Al rooted in founders' HCI and philosophy backgrounds,

and strategic beachhead in noisy early-career hiring. Compared to incumbents like

Greenhouse (workflow-focused) or point solutions like HireVue (static video), HireGlide

combines semantic scoring with conversational assessment for broader applicability

beyond tech roles. Risks include adversarial Al arms races, potential bias homogenization in

the network, and dehumanization perceptions in Al interviews. Overall, it heralds an

"Agent-to-Agent" future, automating screening to let humans focus on high-value closing.

SECTION 2: COMPANY SIZE & REGIONAL FIT

Ideal Company Sizes (select ALL that apply - CSV format):

   .    1-50 employees

   .    51-200 employees


   -    201-500 employees


   O 500+ employees
Evidence for each:
   - 1-50: YC-backed, targets startups with high inbound volume; aligns with YC alumni

       pool.

   - 51-200: Focus on scaling tech companies; integration with Ashby (used by mid-size

       startups).

   - 201-500: Early-career high-volume suitable for growing firms; case studies imply mid-

       market.

   - 500+: Not emphasized; fresher market less critical for enterprises.


Company Size Notes (100 words max): Strategic focus on YC ecosystem and high-growth

startups (1-200 employees) feeling inbound pain. Fresher market suits SMBs with

undifferentiated hiring. Larger firms (201-500) possible via network effects, but no explicit

enterprise features like custom contracts mentioned. Deprioritizes 500+ where complex

compliance dominates.

Supported Regions (select ALL - CSV format):




   0 Australia
   0 Canada
   -    W Global (worldwide)
