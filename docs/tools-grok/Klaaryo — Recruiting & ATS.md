Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered WhatsApp recruiting

platform for high-volume hiring in deskless sectors.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Klaaryo is a conversational Al

platform designed to transform talent acquisition, particularly for high-volume, deskless

workforce sectors such as retail, hospitality, logistics, and facilities management. The

platform leverages WhatsApp as its primary interface, enabling autonomous Al agents to

handle candidate interactions, screening, scheduling, and engagement 24/7. This

addresses key pain points in traditional recruitment, including high abandonment rates (up

to 60% for complex applications), slow response times (44% of candidates disengage if no

response within 72 hours), and interview no-shows.


Core functionality includes initiating personalized conversations via WhatsApp upon

candidate application, conducting structured screening interviews with knockout

questions (e.g., availability, certifications), analyzing responses for soft skills like

communication and relational predisposition using Large Language Models (LLMs), and

orchestrating workflows such as dynamic scheduling with calendar integration and

exception handling (e.g., rescheduling via natural language understanding). The Al

operates autonomously but allows human recruiters to monitor and intervene via a web-

based dashboard, which provides real-time analytics, sentiment analysis, and conversion

metrics.
Key differentiators include its "Agentic Al" architecture, which goes beyond simple

chatbots by executing complex, goal-oriented tasks; a focus on the deskless workforce's

mobile-first habits (90%+ WhatsApp penetration in Europe and LATAM); and integration

with WhatsApp Business API (WABA) for verified, scam-resistant communications. Unlike

legacy ATS systems that digitize paper processes, Klaaryo emphasizes engagement and

speed, claiming to reduce no-shows by 75%, boost hiring probabilities by 40%, and

achieve 90% candidate response rates.


Target users are HR teams and recruiters in enterprises with high turnover and volume

hiring needs, such as chain restaurants (e.g., Burger King, La Piadineria), security firms

(Sicuritalia), and hospitality groups (Big Mamma Group, Nordsee). Ideal buyer personas

include HR directors managing 2,000+ locations, store managers needing quick fills for

frontline roles, and talent acquisition leads frustrated with email-based processes.


Main use cases: (1) Sourcing via QR codes or links leading to instant WhatsApp

applications; (2) 24/7 screening and qualification; (3) Automated Q&A for candidate

queries using company knowledge bases; (4) Interview logistics management; (5) Data

feed into existing HRIS/ATS for structured profiles. Future expansions may include

onboarding, internal mobility, and employee engagement via the same channel.


Al/ML approach: Utilizes LLMs (likely via Microsoft Azure OpenAl for privacy) for

intent/sentiment analysis, moving beyond keyword matching to contextual understanding.

The system is customizable via an "Instruction Panel" for employer-specific criteria.

Overall, Klaaryo positions itself as a European champion in HR Tech, compliant with GDPR

and EU Al Act, backed by €2.1M seed funding, and validated by enterprise adoption. It

partners with rather than replaces traditional ATS, focusing on the "engagement layer" to

bridge the talent gap in a post-pandemic labor market. (Word count: 528)
