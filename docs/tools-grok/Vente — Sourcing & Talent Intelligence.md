Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al business development automation

for recruiters with pain prediction.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

Vente Al is a London-based SaaS platform specializing in recruitment agency business

development (BD) automation. Founded in 2024 by Cameron Briggs, a veteran in

recruitment tech (former Regional Director at XOPA Al and founder of Select Jobs), Vente

Al addresses the inefficiency in client acquisition for agencies. Traditional BD involves

manual research, cold calling, and speculative outreach, often wasting 40% of recruiters’

time on non-revenue activities. Vente Al shifts this paradigm through "pain prediction" — an

algorithmic approach to identify companies with acute talent deficits likely to pay agency

fees (15-25% of salary).

Core functionality revolves around the "Stress Score," a metric derived from analyzing a

company's internal Talent Acquisition (TA) team size against open vacancy volumes. Using

data aggregated from over 200 sources daily, the platform benchmarks ratios: e.g., 50 jobs

to 1 TA manager signals high pain (overwhelm), while 10 jobs to 5 recruiters indicates low

pain (capacity). This intelligence allows recruiters to prioritize high-probability targets,

reducing call volume and increasing conversions.

Key differentiators include vertical specificity for recruitment (unlike general sales tools like

Apollo.io or ZoomInfo), "reverse sourcing" for Most Placeable Candidates (MPCs), and

semantic matching beyond keywords (e.g., equating "Software Engineer" with "Application

Developer"). It supports "Candidate-First" workflows: upload an MPC profile, and Vente

scans millions of vacancies for matches, enabling "Spec CV" blasts. NLP analyzes job

descriptions for urgency ("immediate start"), growth signals ("market expansion"), and

sentiment to tailor pitches. Proprietary filters remove agency-posted jobs, ensuring direct

employer leads.

Target users are recruitment agencies: solo recruiters (Lite tier), micro teams (Scale), SMEs

(Growth), and large divisions (Pro). It democratizes enterprise-grade intelligence, allowing

boutiques to compete with giants like Hays or Randstad without dedicated research teams.

Ideal for tech, engineering, and niche skill sectors where talent shortages are acute.


Main use cases:
   - Lead prioritization: Generate lists of "stressed" companies for outreach.


   > MPC marketing: Automate matching rare candidates to open roles.


   - Market monitoring: Watchlists notify on funding rounds or TA changes.


   - Integration-driven workflows: Push leads to Vincere ATS/CRM with deduplication.


Al/ML approach: Proprietary models for pain prediction, combining structural analysis (TA

ratios), NLP for JD insights, and semantic search. No explicit details on training data or

algorithms, but emphasis on daily data freshness and 95% faster research claims.


Broader implications: By automating "heavy lifting," Vente Al augments recruiters, shifting

focus to negotiation. Early adopters report £12K placements in 4 weeks and £300K+

revenue uplift. Challenges include brand confusion with Venta Al (YC-backed general sales

tool) and competition from SourceBreaker or Manatal. GDPR-compliant with legitimate

interest for B2B contacts. Future potential in autonomous BD loops via integrations like

SourceWhale. Overall, Vente Al represents algorithmic precision in a historically artisanal

industry, with strong ROI (pays for itself in 1-2 placements).

   1.        Pain Prediction engine with Stress Score for lead qualification.


   2. Reverse sourcing for MPCs with semantic skill matching.
