Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-powered interview intelligence for

structured hiring.


Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier):

BrightHire is an interview intelligence platform designed to transform the hiring process by

leveraging Al to enhance efficiency, quality, and fairness. Founded in 2019 and acquired by

Zoom in November 2025, it addresses the "black box" of interviews by capturing,

structuring, and analyzing conversations as data assets. The platform consists of four

pillars: Plan, Screen, Interview, and Decide.


In the Plan module, generative Al creates interview plans, job descriptions, and evaluation

rubrics from basic inputs, ensuring structure and reducing bias for non-expert hiring

managers. BrightHire Screen uses agentic Al for asynchronous preliminary interviews,

conducting voice-based screens and generating structured write-ups, solving the capacity

issue where only 1in 10 applicants typically get screened.


During live interviews, it provides real-time guidance via overlaid interview guides, time-

stamped bookmarking for key moments, and automated note-taking to offload cognitive

tasks, improving candidate experience. The Decide module enables evidence-based

debriefs with playable clips, candidate summaries, and side-by-side comparisons,

integrating directly with ATS scorecards for seamless feedback.


Key differentiators include its focus on validity through structured processes, deep ATS

integrations (e.g., Greenhouse bi-directional sync), and compliance features like bias

audits. Target users are recruiters, hiring managers, and TA leaders in mid-market to

enterprise organizations (200+ employees), particularly in tech, sales, and healthcare. Main

use cases: high-volume recruiting, bias reduction in assessments, interviewer coaching via

insights, and pipeline optimization. Al/ML approach: Combines LLMs for note generation,

NLP for response analysis, and foundational models trained on meeting data (enhanced

post-Zoom acquisition). Outcomes from 25,000+ candidates: 27% fewer interviews per

hire, 28% more scorecards, 19% less drop-off. With Zoom, it evolves video calls into action

systems, offering synergies like multi-lingual screening.


Key Features (5-8 bullet points - CSV-ready):
         .    Al copilot for generating interview plans and rubrics.


              Agentic Al screener for automated first-round interviews.
