   -“’   Performance Management
Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al-native performance enablement

automating feedback and coaching in Slack.

Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Taito.ai is an Al-native performance

enablement platform designed to shift organizations from traditional retrospective

performance management to continuous, proactive enablement. Built on the premise that

annual reviews are burdensome and disconnected from daily workflows, Taito embeds

performance tools directly into Slack, leveraging Al to automate feedback loops, goal

setting, and coaching without requiring context switching. The platform's core

"Performance Intelligence" engine functions as an autonomous agent, analyzing

communications, progress, and feedback to generate personalized nudges, agendas, and

summaries. This addresses chronic issues like low adoption and data poverty in legacy

systems.


Key differentiators include its Slack-first architecture, which situates tasks like feedback

requests and goal updates in the flow of work, boosting engagement. Unlike retrofitted Al

in competitors, Taito is architected natively for Al, enabling bias-resistant summaries and

competency frameworks generated from role data. It integrates seamlessly with Google

Calendar for 1:1 prep and over 50 HRIS systems via Merge API, plus compensation tools like

Pave for closed-loop talent management.

Target users are agile, remote-first tech/SaaS teams of 20-500 employees, particularly

those using Slack and G-Suite. Founders and people leaders benefit from zero-admin

setup (live in under an hour), managers from Al coaching whispers and automated

agendas, and individual contributors from clear expectations and progress tracking.

Leadership gains organizational insights into skill gaps and goal velocity.
Use cases: For hyper-growth scale-ups, it democratizes management by providing rookie

managers with coaching prompts and frameworks. In efficiency-focused SMEs, it

synthesizes feedback into instant reviews, reducing cycles by 70-80%. Al approach:

Proprietary models ingest longitudinal data to mitigate biases like recency effect, while

ensuring privacy (data not used for external training). Customizable to company values, it

fosters a culture of continuous growth rather than compliance. Overall, Taito commoditizes

enterprise-grade tools for mid-market, with aggressive pricing and strong backing from

Accel validating its potential. (428 words)

SECTION 2: COMPANY SIZE & REGIONAL FIT

Ideal Company Sizes (select ALL that apply - CSV format):
   O 1-50 employees
   -      “51-200 employees


   -’     201-500 employees


   O 500+ employees
Evidence for each:


   - 1-50: Not ideal; minimum €250/mo fee suggests larger teams.


   - 51-200: "Lightweight for 20-person team, structured for 500" but sweet spot mid-

        market.

   - 201-500: Case studies like Faculty (400 emp).

   - 500+: Overkill for legacy tools, but possible; low evidence.


Company Size Notes (100 words max): Platform described as fitting "Chaos to Process"

phase (20-500 emp), with pricing (€10/emp/mo, min €250/mo) targeting SMEs and mid-

market. Case studies show 300-400 emp adoption. Not optimized for enterprises needing

heavy custom (separate tier).

GEMINI VALIDATION SUMMARY:

Areas where Gemini was correct: GDPR compliant, funding $2.7M seed 2024, integrations

(Slack Native, Merge API), case study metrics (50% util increase, 300 feedback/week),

implementation under hour.

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: Pricing (Gemini €6 Basic/€10 Performance; Grok

€10 Basic only—site update?); ISO 27001 (Gemini low confidence; Grok confirms certified).

Critical gaps Grok filled: Vendor tier (Tier 2), integration quality (Native/API detail), GBP

conversions, free trial (14 days).
