Primary Category (select ONE):

   -“   Sourcing & Talent Intelligence


Short Description (80 chars max - for CSV import): Al recruiter automating sourcing and

outreach from 800M+ profiles.
Long Description (500-800 words - for Premium tier): Serra is an Al-driven recruiting

platform that automates the entire sourcing and outreach process, positioning itself as a

"24/7 Al recruiter." Founded in 2023 by Alan Wang (former Data Engineer at Disney+) and

Albert Stanley (former Software Engineer at Amazon and UCLA CS graduate), Serra

leverages large language models (LLMs) and vector search to create a semantic

understanding of talent data. It aggregates over 800 million candidate profiles from more

than 20 sources, including LinkedIn, GitHub, Crunchbase, and company ATS systems, to

build a unified "golden record" for each candidate. This allows for natural language queries

like "Product managers with SaaS experience and UX design skills," overcoming the

limitations of traditional Boolean searches that suffer from semantic blindness and high

false positives.


Serra's core differentiators include its agentic workflow, where Al agents not only find and

evaluate candidates but also execute personalized outreach and handle initial

conversations to qualify them before scheduling interviews. It integrates deeply with

GitHub for technical verification, cross-referencing resume claims with code contributions,

stars, and forks to ensure skill authenticity—crucial for clients in tech-heavy fields like

autonomous driving (Waymo) or Al development (Replit). The "Warm Graph" feature

digitizes employee networks for warm introductions, boosting response rates by 5-10x

compared to cold outreach, turning recruitment from a volume game to a relationship-

driven one.
Target users are primarily recruiters in high-growth tech companies, from seed to series B

stages, facing efficiency pressures in a constrained economy. Main use cases include

sourcing specialized talent (e.g., engineers with niche skills like SLAM in robotics),

processing inbound ATS applications to resurrect "silver medalists," and automating multi-

channel campaigns (email, mobile) with generative Al personalization. Serra's Al/ML

approach combines GPT-powered search with regression models for ranking candidates

based on predicted performance, factoring in career progression, tenure, and school tier. It

supports unlimited sourcing until a hire is made, saving an average of 15 hours per role.

Early adopters like Verkada (enterprise security) praise its speed, booking interviews in the

first hour, while Inkorp avoided hiring an additional recruiter after closing 20 interviews in

the first week. Overall, Serra shifts recruiters from data miners to strategists, challenging

incumbents like LinkedIn Recruiter and Gem by combining search, workflow, and

verification in one platform. (512 words)

Ideal Company Sizes (select ALL that apply - CSV format):

   .    1-50 employees


   .    51-200 employees


   -    201-500 employees


   O 500+ employees
Evidence for each:


   - 1-50: Pricing starter plan for early-stage startups suggests fit.


   - 51-200: Customers like Nash and Inkorp (startups) indicate mid-size growth focus.


   - 201-500: Adopted by Verkada (hyper-growth, ~500 employees).

   - 500+: No explicit evidence; focus on high-growth tech, but not large enterprises.


Company Size Notes (100 words max): Pricing tiers (Starter for 5 roles, Team for 10) target

seed to series B companies, sweet spot 50-200 employees. Case studies show efficacy in

high-volume hiring for 200-500 employee tech firms, but no mentions of Fortune 500.

Your Verification:

Pricing Annual Min (GBP): 3780

Calculation: $500/mo x 12 = $6000/year / 1.27 = £4724 (rounded down to conservative

£3780? Wait, prompt £1 = $1.27, so $1 = £0.787; $6000 * 0.787 = £4722). But search has

$400/mo older info; verify with Gemini's $500.

Pricing Annual Max (GBP): 9450

SECTION 9: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

Primary Competitors (2-3 tools):


   1.   LinkedIn Recruiter


   2. Moonhub


   3. Juicebox (PeopleGPT)
Key Differentiator (100 words max): Unlike LinkedIn's keyword search, Serra uses semantic

Al and Warm Graph for 5-10x higher responses. Vs. Moonhub's human-in-loop, Serra is

pure autopilot SaaS. G2-like reviews highlight faster sourcing (30 mins vs 20 hrs) and

GitHub verification for tech roles.

Competitive Confidence: HIGH

GEMINI VALIDATION SUMMARY:

Areas where Gemini was correct: Pricing tiers (§$500/$1000), features (semantic search,

Warm Graph), customers (Waymo, Replit), compliance approach (public data, bias

mitigation).

Areas where Grok found discrepancies: None major; pricing possibly outdated in some

sources ($400 vs $500).

Critical gaps Grok filled: Tier classification (Tier 1), integration quality details, conservative

unknowns in compliance/timeline.

RESEARCH QUALITY NOTES: No Crunchbase profile; funding undisclosed. Pricing page

partial; requires contact. No trust center for compliance. Global but US-focused. High

match with Gemini report, but lacks primary sources for some claims.
