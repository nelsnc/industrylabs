## CONTEXT SNAPSHOT

### 0. PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What We're Building**

IndustryLabs is a B2B AI tool marketplace organized by **industry verticals and use cases**, starting with HR & Talent, then expanding to L&D and Customer Support.

Unlike generic AI tool directories that organize tools by broad categories, we organize by industry-specific workflows that buyers actually care about.

---

**Target Customers**

**Buyers**: HR/Talent/L&D/CS leaders in 50-500 employee companies (GTM focus)

- Need AI tools but lack time/expertise to evaluate dozens of options
- Care about compliance (GDPR, EEOC) and integrations with existing stack
- Want curated recommendations, not overwhelming lists

**Note on Company Size**: Platform directory supports all company sizes as filters (1-50, 51-200, 201-500, 500+ employees), but Year 1 go-to-market and content specifically target 50-500 employee mid-market companies.

**Vendors**: B2B SaaS/AI tool providers in People/Productivity space

- Want qualified, high-intent enterprise leads with full context (budget, timeline, company size)
- Tired of passive directory listings that generate no actionable leads
- Willing to pay for actual lead generation, not just visibility

**Geography (Year 1):** Focus on English-speaking markets (UK, US, Canada, Australia). No non-English localization or country-specific versions in Year 1.

---

**Core Product (Phase 1: HR Only)**

**Curated Tool Directory**

- HR AI tools organized by use case (Recruiting, Onboarding, Performance, Engagement, Analytics)
- Further filtered by company size, compliance requirements, and integrations
- Compliance information (GDPR, EEOC, SOC 2, HIPAA where relevant)
    - **Important**: All compliance information is vendor-supplied and represents indicative guidance only. We do not provide legal advice or formal certification.

**Request Board** (Core Differentiator)

- Buyers describe their specific situation, budget, and constraints
- We match them to 2-3 relevant vendors and provide introductions
- **Scope**: We provide high-intent introductions and facilitate initial contact. We do not guarantee conversions, negotiate deals, or act as a transaction intermediary.
- Vendors receive qualified leads with full context (not anonymous clicks)
- Creates network effects: More buyers → more vendor value → more vendors → better matching → more buyers

**AI-Assisted Content Engine**

- Tool comparisons ("Greenhouse vs Lever"), "Best AI for X" guides, buyer playbooks
- Generated from structured Airtable schema using Claude API
- Workflow: AI generates draft, then human review (20-30 mins), then publish
- Saves ~60% time vs manual writing (2.5 hrs/article vs 6-8 hrs fully manual)

---

**How It Scales (Phase 2-3: L&D and CS)**

**Multi-Vertical Expansion via Vendor Overlap**

- 70% of HR vendors also serve L&D (performance tools, engagement platforms)
- 65% of HR vendors also serve CS (engagement, analytics, workforce planning)
- Once HR validated, we reuse vendor relationships, content templates, and platform infrastructure
- Expansion cost per vertical: approximately 30% of initial HR investment

**Vendor Self-Serve Portal** (Month 9-12, only if triggers met)

- Vendors update their own profiles, pricing, features, and release notes
- Changes automatically flow into listings, comparisons, and guides
- Expected to reduce manual update workload significantly (target: over 50% reduction), with exact efficiency validated through real vendor usage patterns before Month 9
- **Implementation note** (high-level only): Built as a simple authenticated vendor area within the existing Next.js app (backed by Airtable), not a separate product

---

**Business Model & Revenue Logic**

**Free Tier**: Basic listing

- Company name, logo, one-line description
- Searchable within categories
- Website link
- Included in comparison tables

**Premium Tier**: £99/month per vertical (subscriptions are counted per vendor × vertical)

- Enhanced profile page: Full description, screenshots (up to 5), demo video
- Comprehensive features list and integrations directory
- Compliance badges (with disclaimer: vendor-supplied information)
- Priority placement in category pages
- Request Board lead notifications (email within 2 hours)
- Basic analytics dashboard (page views, clicks, requests matched)

**Critical: Subscription Counting Logic**

- Subscriptions are counted **per vertical**, not per vendor
- Each vertical represents distinct audience, placement, and lead source value
- Example: Vendor A subscribes to both HR and L&D = 2 subscriptions = £198/month
- This is fundamental to understanding revenue projections and unit economics

**Revenue from vendor subscriptions only** (no ads, no affiliate links, no pay-per-click)

- Aligned incentives: We succeed when vendors get qualified leads, not when we drive clicks

---

**Why This Works**

**For Buyers**:

- Industry-specific, context-aware results (e.g., "AI for HR at 200-person company with Workday HRIS")
- Not generic "productivity tools" lists that lack actionable context
- Compliance information organized and accessible (disclaimer: vendor-supplied)
- Request Board reduces evaluation time: Describe needs once, get 2-3 pre-vetted introductions

**For Vendors**:

- Qualified leads with full context: Company size, budget, timeline, current stack, pain points
- Higher conversion potential than generic directories (buyer pre-filtered for fit)
- Multi-vertical revenue opportunity: One vendor relationship can generate subscriptions across HR, L&D, CS
- Self-serve updates (Month 9+): Don’t wait for admin to update pricing/features
- Analytics: See which buyer profiles view your tool, which requests you’re matched to

**For Us (Competitive Advantage)**:

- Multi-vertical overlap enables 3x faster expansion than competitors
- Request Board creates data moat (buyer intent graph)
- AI-first content makes scaling economical (not consulting-like)
- Compliance focus creates high barrier for generic marketplaces to replicate

---

**Competitive Moat**

1. **Vertical depth**: Industry-specific taxonomy and content for HR/L&D/CS (not generic "AI tools list")
2. **Compliance layer**: Structured GDPR/EEOC coverage for enterprise adoption (vendor-supplied, organized by us)
3. **Buyer intent graph**: Accumulated data on what buyers ask for, which tools they evaluate, which they adopt; becomes proprietary matching intelligence
4. **AI-first automation**: Content engine plus vendor portal make this scalable, not consulting-like
5. **Network effects**: More buyers → more vendor value → more vendors → better matching → more buyers

---

### 1. CURRENT STATUS

**Date**: November 19, 2025

**Phase**: Month 0, Pre-Launch (Foundation Setup)

**Time Budget**: 28-32 hrs/week planned (expect 33-38 actual), Sprint mode Month 1-3

**Success Definition**:

- **Yellow Zone by Month 12** = £5-8K MRR from 50-80 paid subscriptions (vendor × vertical combinations), typically 25-40 unique vendors across 2-3 operational verticals = validated business model
- **Green Zone** (£8K+ MRR, 80+ subscriptions, 40+ vendors, 3 verticals) = stretch performance, not requirement
- Do not treat Yellow as failure

**Current Numbers**:

- Paying Vendors: 0 / 5 target (Month 3)
- Paid Subscriptions: 0 / 8-12 target (Month 3, assuming 1.5-2x verticals per vendor)
- MRR: £0 / £800-1,500 target (Month 3)
- Articles Published: 0 / 8 target (Month 3)
- Monthly Visitors: 0 / 500 target (Month 3)
- Request Board Submissions: 0 / 10 target (Month 3)
- Platform Status: Foundation Complete (Production at [https://industrylabs.vercel.app](https://industrylabs.vercel.app/))

### 2. ACTIVE STRATEGY DECISIONS (Copy for new conversations)

**Strategic Framework**

1. **Phase 1 Focus**: HR vertical only (Month 1-4). Do NOT start L&D until HR hits Yellow or Green at Gate 1.
2. **Pricing Rule (Year 1 ONLY)**: Free + £99 Premium per vertical. NO £199 tier. NO complex add-ons until Month 10+, and only if vendors repeatedly request specific features.
3. **Success = Yellow Zone**: £5-8K MRR, 50-80 subscriptions (25-40 vendors), 2-3 verticals = validated business. Green is bonus.
4. **Subscription Counting**: Subscriptions counted per vertical, not per vendor, because each vertical is distinct placement and lead source.
5. **Vendor Portal Triggers**: Do NOT build until ALL met: 10 paying vendors + 15 updates/week + >10hrs manual work + vendors explicitly asking.
6. **Multi-Vertical Sequence**: HR → L&D (70% overlap) → CS (65% overlap). NOT HR → Legal / Finance.

**Execution Principles**

1. **Content Production**: AI-assisted (Claude API drafts → you review 20-30 mins → publish). Target 24-28 articles total. Judge quarterly, not monthly.
2. **Automation Strategy**:
    - Year 1: AI draft + human review (2.5 hrs/article)
    - Year 2: Higher automation (vendor updates → AI generates change summaries → you spot-check)
3. **Time Management**: Accept 28-32 planned = 33-38 actual. Front-load Month 1-3 (35-38 hrs sprint), then sustainable 30-35 hrs Month 4-12.
4. **VA Hiring**: At £3K MRR OR burnout risk (whichever first). Don’t wait for £5K if drowning.
5. **Hard Stop Rule**: If HR in Red zone at Month 4 (under 5 vendors, under £400 MRR, under 10 requests), DO NOT start L&D. Month 5-6 = fix HR first.

**AI Enhancement Strategy**

1. **Content Production**: AI-assisted (Claude API drafts → you review 20-30 mins → publish). Target 24-28 articles total. Judge quarterly, not monthly.
2. **Agent Deployment Timeline**:
    - Month 1-3: No agents (focus on foundation and manual validation)
    - Month 4-12: Deploy Content Writer agent (target 30-40% time savings on articles)
    - Month 13+: Evaluate additional agents based on bottlenecks (Vendor Research, Request Matcher)
3. **Agent Philosophy**: Use AI for leverage, not replacement. You remain orchestrator, not executor.
4. **Reality Check**: Each agent requires 10-15 hrs setup + 1-2 hrs/week maintenance. Only deploy when ROI is clear.

**Risk Protection**

1. **Compliance Disclaimer**: All compliance info is vendor-supplied and indicative only. We do not provide legal advice or formal certification.
2. **Request Board Scope**: We provide high-intent introductions. We do not guarantee conversions, negotiate deals, or act as transaction intermediary.

### PARALLEL EXECUTION RULES

**Rule 1: Thread 1 tasks are asynchronous**
- Claude Code can work on TASK-201 to TASK-212 without waiting for Nelson
- Nelson reviews output but doesn't block progress
- Nelson can request fixes in next iteration

**Rule 2: Thread 2 tasks are sequential within categories**
- Must complete AI research before sending EMAIL 1A
- Must complete vendor outreach before processing responses
- Articles can be written in any order

**Rule 3: Cross-thread dependencies are explicit**
- Thread 2 cannot start TASK-413 until Thread 1 completes TASK-205
- Thread 2 cannot test TASK-215 until Thread 1 completes TASK-210
- Both threads must sync at weekly checkpoints

**Rule 4: Time estimates are conservative**
- Thread 1 tasks may complete faster (AI assistance)
- Thread 2 tasks may take longer (human communication delays)
- Build 20% buffer into weekly plans

**Rule 5: Prioritize unblocking over perfection**
- Thread 1: Ship 80% solution to unblock Thread 2, iterate later
- Thread 2: Use mock data if Thread 1 delayed, replace with real data later
- Both threads: Weekly demo/sync to catch issues early

## AI Pair-Programming SOP

When working on any dev task, use AI as follows:

**1. CLARIFY (2-5 minutes)**

- Summarize the goal
- Link to Execution Hub task ID
- Paste relevant code/files into assistant

**2. PLAN (Use GPT-5, 5-10 minutes)**
Ask GPT-5 to:

- Break task into 3-7 concrete steps
- Identify risks, edge cases, tests needed
- Confirm which files/components will be touched
- Output: Short checklist

**3. IMPLEMENT (Use Claude Code, 15-30 minutes)**
Open repo in VS Code with Claude Code:

- Navigate file tree and apply planned edits
- Keep changes scoped to agreed checklist
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` locally
- Fix any issues before proceeding

**4. REVIEW (Use GPT-5, 5-10 minutes)**
Paste final diff or key files into GPT-5:

- Request code review (readability, safety, performance)
- Get suggestions for better naming, abstractions, tests
- Iterate if needed

**5. CROSS-CHECK (Optional, Use Alternative Model, 5 minutes)**
For security, performance-critical, or tricky algorithms:

- Get second opinion from Gemini or another model
- Focus on specific concerns

**Any AI assistant helping with IndustryLabs should:**

- Respect this SOP
- Clearly state whether they are in **PLAN**, **IMPLEMENT**, or **REVIEW** mode
- Never skip the review step for complex changes

**Example Workflows**:

**Vendor Data Import**:

- CLARIFY: "Import AI research JSON for Greenhouse to Airtable, following schema v2.3"
- PLAN (GPT-5):
  - Break down into TOOLS fields vs TOOLS_INTEGRATIONS records
  - Identify field mapping (JSON keys → Airtable field names)
  - Note any transformations needed (e.g., "2-4 weeks" → min: 2, max: 4)
- IMPLEMENT (Claude Code):
  - Write script to parse JSON and prepare Airtable payloads
  - Test with one tool first
  - Handle errors gracefully (missing fields, malformed data)
- REVIEW (GPT-5):
  - Verify all Tier 1 fields populated
  - Check TOOLS_INTEGRATIONS records created correctly
  - Ensure no duplicate integration records

## BLOCKERS / DECISIONS NEEDED

**Active Blockers**:

- None yet (just starting Next.js pivot)

**Decisions This Week**:

- [ ]  Confirm final initial route list for MVP (e.g., `/`, `/about`, `/hr-talent`, `/tools/[slug]`, `/articles/[slug]`, `/request`)
- [ ]  Decide on design baseline (full-width vs contained layout, spacing scale, etc.)
- [ ]  Confirm doing **full Airtable schema now** (recommended) vs minimal v1

---

## MONTHLY MILESTONE TRACKING

### Month 1 Target (December 2025)

- Platform: Next.js app live with core pages and 8-10 tools from Airtable
- Content: 3-4 articles published
- Vendors: 1-3 paying vendors, 2-5 subscriptions, £200-500 MRR
- Traffic: 200-500 monthly visitors
- Requests: 3-5 Request Board submissions

### Month 3 Target (February 2026) – GATE 1

- Platform: HR sub-categories functional, Request Board stable
- Content: 8-10 articles published
- Vendors: 5-8 paying vendors, 8-15 subscriptions, £800-1,500 MRR
- Traffic: 500-1,500 monthly visitors
- Requests: 10-15 Request Board submissions
- **Decision**: Proceed to L&D or iterate HR

### Month 6 Target (May 2026) – GATE 2

- Verticals: HR + L&D operational
- Vendors: 15-20 paying, 25-40 subscriptions, £2,500-£4,000 MRR
- Traffic: 1,500-3,000 monthly visitors
- Content: 18-22 articles
- **Decision**: Build Vendor Portal (full or v0.5)?

### Month 12 Target (November 2026) – EXIT READINESS

- **Yellow Zone Success**: £5-8K MRR, 50-80 subscriptions (25-40 vendors), 2-3 verticals, 20-27 articles
- **Green Zone Stretch**: £8K+ MRR, 80+ subscriptions (40+ vendors), 3 verticals, 28+ articles
- **Outcome**: Ready to list for sale or scale into Year 2

### Month 12: Exit Readiness Assessment

**Required Achievements**:

- Performance in Yellow or Green zone (see Section I)
- Documented operational processes
- VA managing 30-40% of routine operations
- 12+ months financial performance history
- Stable or growing MRR trend
- Preparation for sale listing or Year 2 scaling decision

**NEW: Strategic Path Decision** (Added 2025-11-26)
Evaluate whether to continue £2M sustainable path OR pursue £10M scaling:

**£2M Path Signals** (Continue current pace):

- £5-8K MRR (Yellow Zone = Success)
- <8% monthly churn
- Stable growth (5-10% MoM)
- 15-25 paying vendors
- 3-8K monthly visitors

**£10M Path Signals** (Consider acceleration):

- £10K+ MRR
- <3% monthly churn
- Strong growth (20%+ MoM for 3+ consecutive months)
- 25-35 paying vendors
- 8-10K monthly visitors
- Clear path to multi-vertical expansion

**Action**:

- If £2M signals → Continue current operations, plan Month 24 exit
- If £10M signals → Evaluate: Add 2-3 AI agents, expand verticals faster, possibly quit Jefferies Month 18-24
- If <£5K MRR (Red Zone) → Iterate positioning or prepare exit

---

## DANGER SIGNS (Check Monthly)

Stop immediately and reassess if experiencing:

- Consistently >40 hrs/week for >2 months
- Missing Jefferies deadlines or performance declining
- Health issues or relationship strain
- Work quality declining in both jobs
- Vendor research taking >90 mins per tool (should be 55-80 mins with AI assistance)
- Data import taking >30 mins per tool (should be 20-25 mins with templates)
- Form response rate <30% after 1 week (indicates email approach needs adjustment)

**Emergency Protocol**:

1. Take 1 week complete break
2. Cut scope by 30% upon return
3. Hire VA immediately (even if <£3K MRR)
4. Pause new verticals; focus on HR only
5. Remember: Yellow Zone = Success; Burnout = Total Failure

---

## SUCCESS MANTRAS (Read Weekly)

1. **Yellow is Success, Green is Bonus** – £6K MRR validates the model. Don’t let perfect kill good.
2. **First 10 Vendors Are Hardest** – Expect 3-5 hours each initially. It gets easier with social proof.
3. **Task-Based over Time-Based** – Focus on completing tasks, not hours. Some tasks will take longer than expected.
4. **AI-Assisted over Fully Manual** – Use Claude/ChatGPT for drafts. You are the editor, not the scribe.
5. **Ship Before Perfect** – 60% done and live beats 100% perfect and delayed.
6. **Subscriptions per Vertical** – Revenue is vendor × vertical, not just vendor count.

## THREAD ASSIGNMENT QUICK REFERENCE

### How to Decide: Thread 1 vs Thread 2?

**Assign to THREAD 1 (CODE/AI) if task**:
- ✅ Creates/modifies code files
- ✅ Updates database schema
- ✅ Implements UI components
- ✅ Writes utility functions
- ✅ Can be tested programmatically
- ✅ Has clear acceptance criteria (e.g., "function returns correct output")
- ✅ Requires no human judgment or negotiation

**Examples**: TASK-201 to TASK-212, TASK-206 to TASK-208

**Assign to THREAD 2 (MANUAL) if task**:
- ✅ Requires reading/analyzing content
- ✅ Requires vendor communication
- ✅ Requires strategic judgment (e.g., "Is this pricing reasonable?")
- ✅ Requires quality assessment (e.g., "Is this article good enough?")
- ✅ Requires business decisions (e.g., "Should we offer discount?")
- ✅ Requires empathy/persuasion (e.g., vendor outreach)

**Examples**: TASK-401, TASK-410, TASK-413, TASK-417, TASK-418, all content tasks

**Assign to INTEGRATED if task**:
- ⚠️ Requires BOTH code automation AND human judgment
- ⚠️ Has handoff points between threads
- ⚠️ Requires iteration between AI output and human review

**Examples**: TASK-215 (testing), AI research workflow (TASK-410 has AI + manual components)
