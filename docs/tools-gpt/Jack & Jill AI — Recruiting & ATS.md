Jack & Jill AI – Company Overview

Jack & Jill AI is a London-based recruitment startup founded in early 2025 by serial entrepreneur Matthew Wilson and Saaras Mehan[1]. The company’s mission is to “reimagine hiring from first principles” by deploying two “agentic” AI assistants – Jack for candidates and Jill for employers – that conduct human-like conversations to match people with jobs. Jack interviews job-seekers via a ~20‑minute AI-powered voice chat to record their background, skills and career goals, then surfaces relevant roles from public listings and partner databases[2][3]. Jill separately interviews hiring teams (often via live calls) to build a detailed role profile (must-haves, compensation, team context) and then combs Jack’s network to identify and flag matching candidates[4][5]. The founders emphasize that the platform is built around conversational AI rather than resume shuffling – it “reconstructs the system from scratch” with empathetic, autonomous agents[6][7]. Jack & Jill AI closed a $20 million seed round led by Creandum in late 2025[8]. From its London launch (50,000 users and hundreds of customers to date[9]), it is now expanding to the U.S. market.

Core Features

Jack & Jill combines candidate sourcing, outreach and tracking into one workflow. On the candidate side, Jack (the AI “career coach”) guides users through a voice interview to build their profile (work history, skills, preferences)[2]. Once the profile is complete, Jack sends curated job matches by email whenever relevant openings arise[10]. Jack also offers mock interview practice and résumé/answer coaching in the context of specific roles. Candidates can accept introductions directly to hiring managers (“off-market opportunities via Jill”[11]) and receive 24/7 support and reminders – the AI “remembers everything” so it can follow up or pick up conversations at any time[12][13].

On the employer side, Jill (the AI recruiter) conducts in-depth intake calls with hiring teams to define the ideal candidate. Using a conversational flow (similar to an experienced recruiter), Jill elicits requirements (hard/soft skills, compensation band, culture fit) and then continuously sources from Jack’s pre-screened network. The system automatically curates shortlists of “world-class” candidates for each role as soon as a new job is added[14][4]. Employers receive candidate profiles via email or a dashboard: they review Jill’s AI-curated matches, give feedback (which refines the AI’s future search), and are directly introduced to candidates who have expressed interest[15]. In effect, Jack & Jill combines features of an applicant tracking system (role and company profile management) with automated outreach and coordination. Crucially, no action is required until hires are made – the employer pays only on success (10% of salary) and can focus on interviews while Jack & Jill handles sourcing, screening and follow-up.

Key workflow automations include: AI-led screening interviews; continuous matching without manual posting; automated candidate outreach and scheduling; and real-time candidate follow-ups. The founders note that the platform can “chat with thousands of candidates” simultaneously, scaling the work of an agency recruiter[16][13]. Customers report significantly faster hiring and higher-quality shortlists than through traditional means. For example, Maze’s VP of Ops says it was “a lot faster to get good candidates from Jill than any agency we’ve worked with”[17].

AI Capabilities

Jack & Jill’s core is AI-powered matching. Both Jack and Jill are conversational agents built on LLM-like technology and custom data models. For candidates, Jack conducts the entire first-round interview autonomously, extracting nuance about career pivots, motivations, and constraints that a static résumé misses[18]. The system then translates each interview into a structured “skills graph” and behavioral profile, scoring alignment with open roles[18]. This drives two loops: tailored coaching for candidates, and ranked candidate shortlists for employers.

On the employer side, Jill’s algorithm goes beyond keyword filters. By capturing dialogue about “must-haves vs. nice-to-haves” and company culture[4], the AI can match latent signals (e.g. seniority comfort, relocation constraints) as well as hard requirements. It also includes guardrails (human-defined disqualifiers and preferences) to limit hallucinations or bias. In short, Jack & Jill applies AI to all early recruitment steps – from parsing spoken answers to generating and personalizing outreach – turning conversations into data. The founders contrast this with “spray-and-pray” resume shuffling, arguing that conversational AI produces richer profiles and more precise matches[19][18].

Integrations

Jack & Jill is designed to mesh with existing hiring ecosystems. The platform aggregates jobs and profiles from “online databases” and partner feeds[5][2], which implies connectivity to job boards and professional networks (akin to APIs from Indeed/LinkedIn feeds). On the ATS/HRIS side, Jack & Jill plans “native integrations to leading applicant tracking systems and HR platforms (e.g. Greenhouse, Workday, Lever)”[20], so that data can flow to whichever system a company already uses. (The team acknowledges in development that ATS integration is needed[21].) In practice, Jack & Jill overlays on top of standard workflows – it imports job requisitions and exports candidate info to avoid double data entry – while also enabling off-platform introductions.

Pricing Model

Jack & Jill uses a simple success-based pricing model. Job seekers pay nothing to use Jack – it’s free for candidates[22]. Employers pay only a placement fee (10% of the hired candidate’s first-year salary) when a hire is made[13][23]. There are no up-front costs or monthly subscriptions[23]. If a hire leaves within 3 months, the fee is refunded[13]. In marketing copy Jill even calls this “half the price of agency recruiters” with “1000× the network”[13]. In short, companies incur cost only when a candidate sourced by Jack & Jill is successfully placed – aligning incentives and lowering risk.

Target Customers

Jack & Jill has primarily targeted fast-growing tech companies and startups. By late 2025 the service is live in London with “hundreds of fast-growing firms” using Jill on their hiring teams[24]. Early adopters include venture-backed startups (e.g. Maze, Encord) hiring for competitive roles. The candidate side has attracted over 49,000 registered users in London[9], indicating strong traction among active job-seekers. With its recent funding round, Jack & Jill is now expanding into the San Francisco Bay Area and broader U.S. market[25], suggesting an ideal geography of tech hubs in North America and Europe. Company size is typically small-to-medium enterprises scaling headcount; the founders emphasize accessibility “for companies hiring at every level” and cost-savings compared to agencies.

Compliance and Data Privacy

As an AI-driven hiring platform, Jack & Jill claims to operate with compliance in mind. The company acknowledges that employment algorithms fall under high-risk regulations (EU AI Act) and anti-discrimination law (EEOC guidelines)[26]. To address this, Jack & Jill keeps humans “in the loop” for all final hiring decisions, uses only job-related criteria in its models, and provides transparency to candidates (e.g. how data is used and how to opt out)[27]. The platform includes hard disqualifiers and audit logs to enable impact testing. While specific certifications (ISO, SOC) are not publicized, the founders stress structured data collection and explainability to satisfy regulators and large enterprise buyers[27].

Competitive Positioning

Jack & Jill sits at the intersection of AI recruiting tools and ATS/recruitment services. Unlike a traditional ATS (e.g. Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby) that sells user licenses and manages a pipeline, Jack & Jill functions more like a “staffing agency” powered by AI – sourcing and screening on behalf of the employer. For example, Ashby is an all-in-one SaaS ATS (with analytics and workflow automation) that typically costs ~$300+/month for small teams[28]. Dover offers a free ATS plus optional AI-powered recruiters, charging roughly $2–8K per placement[28]. In contrast, Jack & Jill charges a 10% placement fee with no fixed fees[13], effectively sharing risk with the employer. The use of conversational chatbots also distinguishes it from pure matching tools (like Eightfold or Paradox) and from linear screening platforms (like HireVue). In summary, Jack & Jill promotes itself as a faster, cheaper alternative to agencies and a more candidate-friendly overlay to ATS systems[13][23]. Its closest peers are the emerging AI recruitment assistants (Dover, Wade) but with a unique two-sided, voice-driven approach.
