Veloxhire.AI – AI Video Interview Platform (Assessment & Interviewing)

Veloxhire.AI is a cloud-based AI video interviewing tool for initial candidate screening (not a full ATS). Launched in June 2023 by Vinit Yadav, it “conducts human-like interviews” and generates detailed scorecards to help companies “find top talent 5x faster”[1]. The platform emphasizes asynchronous, on-demand screening: recruiters build a job assessment (select role, skills/topics, questions or let AI generate them) and then Veloxhire’s AI “interviewer” invites candidates to respond any time. The AI interviewer is available 24×7, eliminating scheduling hassles[2][1]. It asks role-specific follow-ups, records and transcribes answers in real time, and returns structured, “unbiased” feedback and analytics so recruiters can shortlist efficiently[3][4]. In short, Veloxhire pitches itself as offloading the scheduling and first-round interviewing tasks to AI, slashing time-to-hire and reducing bias[5][6].

Key Features & Workflow

AI-Powered Video Interviews: Veloxhire’s “human-like AI interviewer” adapts to any role and speaks with candidates via video/audio. It conducts 1-way interviews (candidates record responses on demand), with the AI automatically generating or asking customized questions based on the job skills[5][7].

24×7 Availability: Candidates can interview at their convenience (across time zones) and the AI runs interviews continuously. Veloxhire highlights “no more scheduling juggling” – the AI handles invites and reminders 24/7[2][8].

Customization & Templates: Recruiters can choose or customize interview templates by role. They pick topics/skills and questions (or have the AI create them) and can mimic company-specific processes[9][10].

Recording & Reporting: All responses are recorded and transcribed. The system scores/evaluates each candidate on a uniform rubric. Recruiters get side-by-side dashboards or scorecards comparing candidates’ performance[11][12]. The AI claims to provide structured, unbiased feedback (free of human inconsistency)[13][14].

AI Proctoring / Fraud Detection: Veloxhire includes AI proctoring to flag dishonesty. For example, their documentation notes the AI “monitors all activities that deviate from established norms” and can detect cheating (e.g. use of external tools)[4][15].

High-Volume Scaling: The platform is built for bulk hiring. It stresses “screen, interview, and assess hundreds in a day”[16] and touts the ability to process thousands of applications quickly[17]. By comparison, traditional one-way video tools (e.g. Spark Hire) simply record interviews; Veloxhire adds AI analytics on top.

Pricing

Veloxhire uses a pay-per-interview model (priced in Indian rupees). There are three published plans[18][19]:

Starter (₹299/interview) – ~USD 3.6 per interview. Up to 20 interviews per month, 2 active job slots, 15 minutes max per interview, 1 recruiter seat, email support. (This is actually a 1-month trial plan, no credit card.)[20]

Premium (₹449/interview) – ~USD 5.4 per interview. Up to 500 interviews/month, 20 active jobs, 30 minutes per interview, 10 seats, priority email & phone support. (No long-term commitment; pay as you go.)[19]

Enterprise (Custom) – “Let’s Talk” plan for very high volume. Includes up to 10,000 interviews/month, unlimited job slots and seats, unlimited interview length, dedicated account manager, etc.[21]

There are no hidden fees or setup costs and no per-seat licensing – you only pay per completed AI interview[18]. A 30-day free trial is offered with no credit card required[22]. (TrustRadius confirms pricing is listed in INR per interview[23].) Compared to competitors, Veloxhire’s per-interview pricing is relatively low; for instance HireVue’s pricing (per interview or per seat) is generally higher and enterprise-level[23][24].

Integrations & Workflow Fit

Veloxhire presents itself as an ATS-adjacent tool. The website and marketing emphasize that it augments existing hiring processes rather than replacing an ATS. According to Veloxhire’s own materials, the system offers “robust integration capabilities” with existing HR and ATS systems[25]. (However, no public list of connectors is given.) In practice, organizations would typically export candidates from their ATS or job board into Veloxhire for screening, then import the shortlisted candidates back. The focus is on the interview step: “we manage scheduling, no-shows, and talent shortlisting” while recruiters make the final decisions[18][12].

By comparison, major video-interview platforms explicitly list ATS integrations. HireVue, for example, touts “seamless ATS integration” and even FedRAMP authorization for security[26]. Veloxhire’s smaller scale means integrations may be more custom or via API/Zapier (not documented). In summary, Veloxhire is positioned as an AI-first interviewing/co-pilot layer in the hiring workflow, slotting in after sourcing but before human interviewers.

Compliance & Security

Veloxhire is headquartered in India (Ahmedabad) under Veloxcore Private Limited[27]. Its privacy policy states compliance with applicable laws (Indian data protection rules) and indicates that stricter local regulations (e.g. GDPR) would override its policy[28][29]. While the site does not list specific certifications (no mention of ISO or SOC2), it does emphasize data privacy. In educational content, Veloxhire notes that AI interviewers should adhere to GDPR/CCPA standards and protect candidate data[29]. Security is also a marketing point: Veloxhire adds AI proctoring/fraud features to prevent cheating[4], and claims “trusted security” in line with industry norms. (By contrast, HireVue highlights FedRAMP and SOC compliance[26].)

In practice, as a SaaS platform, Veloxhire likely uses encrypted connections and secure cloud hosting, but we found no public third-party audits. Customers interested in compliance would need to inquire directly. It’s worth noting all processing appears to be managed on Veloxhire’s servers (no on-prem option), so data residency follows where Veloxhire hosts (not specified). Overall, Veloxhire appears to follow standard privacy practices and stresses regulatory alignment, but detailed security specs are not published on the site.

Implementation & Realism

Veloxhire is a pure SaaS solution with minimal onboarding friction. Users can sign up online (free trial, no credit card) and build an interview workflow in minutes[30][22]. The UI walks recruiters through creating a company profile, defining roles/skills, and customizing questions[30][31]. Because it’s asynchronous video-based, candidates simply log in to a web interface to record answers (Veloxhire claims it feels like a real conversation). The system handles invites, reminders, and transcription automatically.

In short, implementation seems straightforward: no software installation or hardware needed, and little training should be required. Veloxhire provides support via email (and phone for Premium plans), but the free trial and pay-as-you-go model implies a “start small and expand” usage. Testimonials (and images on the site) suggest small and mid-sized tech companies already use it. For high-volume recruiters (campus hiring, mass screenings), Veloxhire promises rapid scaling without adding headcount.

Competitors & Benchmarking

Veloxhire competes in the AI interview/assessment niche. Key comparators include:

Alex (ai) – An autonomous AI “recruiter” that engages candidates via live phone/video calls, 24/7. Alex handles scheduling and conducts two-way interviews, asking role-specific questions and even flagging cheating (e.g. ChatGPT use)[32][15]. Alex is more agent-like (it calls candidates on real phone/video streams) whereas Veloxhire uses a web interface for on-demand video. Both emphasize AI-driven screening and integration into ATS.

Outrove.ai – An end-to-end AI recruiting platform. Outrove can build pipelines, source candidates, and runs AI interviews (using Zoom/Meet to give a natural, human-like feel)[33]. It supports multi-step workflows (emails, tests, interviews) and tracks data in one system. Veloxhire is narrower in scope, focusing purely on the interviewing piece, while Outrove is broader (sourcing through hiring). Both claim “human-like” AI conversation; Outrove explicitly mentions natural body language and filler words[33].

HireVue – A well-known video interviewing and assessment suite. HireVue offers both on-demand and live video interviews, AI assessments (including games and coding), and deep analytics. Its platform is enterprise-grade (FedRAMP-certified, integrates with Workday/Oracle/SAP, etc.)[26]. Veloxhire is more lightweight/affordable and geared toward rapid deployment, whereas HireVue is often chosen by large enterprises with complex compliance needs. Both promise bias reduction and faster hiring, though HireVue’s pricing and feature set are much larger.

Spark Hire – A traditional video interviewing tool offering one-way (pre-recorded) and live interviews. Spark Hire does not use AI analysis – it simply records candidate video answers for recruiters to review. Its value is scheduling efficiency and fairness (every candidate gets the same questions)[34][35]. Veloxhire builds on this concept by adding AI-driven scoring, feedback, and adaptive questioning. In effect, Spark Hire is a baseline (video-only) comparand, while Veloxhire is Spark+AI analytics.

In summary, Veloxhire sits between high-end AI agents (Alex/Outrove) and basic video tools (Spark Hire). It offers more AI “smarts” than a legacy one-way system, but with simpler SaaS deployment than a heavyweight solution. Its competitors like HireVue are more feature-rich but also more expensive. Veloxhire’s niche is small-to-mid enterprises and high-volume recruiters who want AI interviewing without a full HR suite.
