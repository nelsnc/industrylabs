Tezi (Max): Autonomous AI Recruiting Agent

AI-native status: Tezi is a very recent AI-driven startup (seed-funded in mid-2024[1]) whose entire product – the “Max” recruiting agent – is built around machine learning. Tezi’s founders (former leaders in tech recruiting) explicitly designed Max as an agentic AI system. The company describes Max as using “dozens of specialized agents” to perform recruiting tasks end-to-end[2]. In short, Tezi was founded post-2020 and centers on AI/ML in recruiting, so it meets the “AI-native” criteria.

Core capabilities and use cases: Max is pitched as a full-cycle recruiting assistant. Key features include:- Proactive sourcing: Once a job is set up (with a profile of the ideal hire), Max autonomously searches a global database (∼750 M profiles) for candidates, sends personalized outreach emails on your behalf, and builds candidate lists[3][4].- Screening: Max reviews and ranks inbound applications. It handles initial candidate Q&A and screens out poor fits so only the strongest candidates advance[5].- Scheduling: Max coordinates complex interview schedules across calendars. It integrates with Google Calendar, Outlook, Zoom/Google Meet, etc., to auto-schedule or re-schedule interviews instantly[6].- Communication: Max chats with candidates (24/7) to answer routine questions and follow up on tasks. For example, it “follows up about missing scorecards, chases down candidates, and nags hiring managers” to keep processes moving[7].- Slack-based interface: Recruiters can work with Max via Slack – simply issuing natural-language commands in their workspace[8]. This makes the AI agent “work where you do” without adding new software.

In practice Tezi positions Max as a partner to (not replacement for) human recruiters, freeing them from tedious tasks. As Tezi’s marketing notes, Max “independently sources, screens, and schedules” so recruiters can focus on higher-level tasks[8][4]. Tezi even offers a basic built-in ATS to keep hiring organized (or it can sync with your existing ATS)[9]. The FAQs emphasize use cases in tech/finance hiring – e.g. high-volume roles like engineers, product designers, sales reps, or niche searches from new-grad to director levels[10]. In one testimonial, a startup’s recruiting lead says Max “found 29 strong candidates for a recent role” and enabled a hire “in a little more than one month”[11].

Compliance and security: Tezi highlights enterprise-grade security and bias controls. The site notes that Max is SOC 2 certified, compliant with data-privacy laws (CCPA), and has undergone a third-party bias audit (NYC Local Law 144)[12]. Tezi explicitly states it does not train its models on customer data, and that Max “can’t make rejection decisions” on its own[12] – implying human oversight for hiring decisions. In short, Tezi meets standard HR/security compliance expectations (privacy, auditing, non-bias) and aims for GDPR/EEO-readiness as well. (Its privacy policy, effective May 2024, covers U.S. privacy rights; GDPR compliance is not explicitly stated on the site but is presumably under development.)

Integrations: Tezi is designed to plug into common recruiting infrastructure. It offers flexible ATS support: Tezi provides its own simple ATS if needed, or “integrates seamlessly” with popular third-party ATS platforms[9]. On the website, Tezi explicitly lists API-level connectors for Greenhouse and Lever (and newer ATS like Ashby)[13]. In addition, Max connects to calendar and meeting tools: the interface supports Google Meet/Calendar, Zoom, and Outlook/Office 365 for interview scheduling[13]. In summary, major ATS and scheduling systems are supported out of the box, making it easy to add Max to an existing HR stack[9][13].

Ideal customer profile: Tezi is primarily aimed at growth-stage tech companies and lean recruiting teams. Marketing materials emphasize “tiny HR & Talent teams” and founders of early-stage startups[14][15]. In practice, the sweet spot is likely mid-market firms (roughly 50–500 employees, often in tech or finance) that need to scale hiring without expanding headcount. Customers cited on the site (e.g. Mutiny, Pocus) are high-growth tech organizations. The product is most relevant for professional, desk-based roles – high-volume positions like software engineers, sales reps, designers, etc. – though Tezi says it can also hunt for very niche hires[10]. Geographically, Tezi is U.S.-based (Menlo Park, CA) but its AI looks at a global candidate pool.

IndustryLabs Premium fit: Tezi checks the boxes for a curated AI-native HR tool. It was founded after 2020 with AI/ML at its core[1][2], and it squarely addresses Sourcing & Talent Intelligence by automating recruiter workflows. The product’s autonomous “agentic AI” approach (as noted by investors) is novel and enterprise-ready[2][16]. Its target market (small-to-mid-size companies) aligns with IndustryLabs’s audience. In a marketplace context, Tezi’s major selling points – full-stack recruiting agent, Slack integration, built-in ATS – would be compelling to HR buyers. In short, Tezi appears well-suited for a Premium listing, given its AI-native pedigree and alignment with IndustryLabs’s mid-market focus.

Traction and credibility: Tezi has garnered some notable external validation. It raised a $9M seed round in July 2024, led by prominent VCs (8VC, Audacious Ventures) and backed by angels (founders of Instacart, Thumbtack, etc.)[1]. The company’s blog quotes investors calling Tezi “the first recruiting AI agent that autonomously runs the recruiting workflow end to end,” giving recruiters a “strategic edge”[16]. On the customer side, Tezi publicizes testimonials and case studies from actual users. For example, a Head of Operations at Mutiny reports that Max “replaced our need to source at all for some roles,” finding dozens of strong candidates in a month[11]. Similarly, a Head of Engineering at Pocus notes that Max “excel[s] at capturing our nuanced target candidate profile” and has been an “excellent complement” during high-growth hiring sprints[17]. These references (along with logos of users like Mutiny, Point, Datahub) suggest growing adoption.

Overall, Tezi (Max) presents itself as a cutting-edge AI recruiting assistant with solid seed backing and early customer proof points. It aligns well with an AI-native HR tools marketplace: it’s founded on AI, enhances sourcing/talent intelligence, meets compliance requirements, integrates with HR systems, and targets the mid-market – making it a strong candidate for a curated Premium listing.
