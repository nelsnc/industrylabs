Serra

Directory Inclusion (Core Identity + Category Fit)

Official Name: Serra (slug: serra)

Website: serra.io[1]

Description: An AI-powered recruiting assistant that automates candidate sourcing and outreach. Serra’s platform leverages a vector-based search over ~800M+ profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, Crunchbase, etc.) and integrates with your ATS to surface qualified candidates and book interviews on autopilot[1][2].

Primary Vertical: Sourcing & Talent Intelligence

Secondary Vertical: (If applicable) AI Recruiting / Automation

Buyer Decision Factors (Tier 1)

Pricing: Subscription plans by active roles. Publicly listed plans (USD) are: Starter at \$500/mo (~£4–5k/yr) for up to 5 active roles, and Team at \$1000/mo (~£8–10k/yr) for up to 10 roles[3][4]. (Conversion: \$6k/yr ≈£4.5k; \$12k/yr ≈£9k.) These include AI candidate search and ATS integration. Larger firms (200–500 employees) would likely need the Enterprise tier (unlimited roles, custom features) – pricing is custom/contact (likely five-figure £/year)[5]. No per-seat charges; model is flat fee per plan tier.

Integrations: Serra offers native ATS integrations (80+ systems)[6] – connecting tools like Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc. to import applicants. It also enriches profiles from external sources (LinkedIn, GitHub, Crunchbase, Indeed)[1]. Outreach is handled via users’ email and LinkedIn accounts (built-in email and LinkedIn campaign templates)[7]. Interview scheduling implies Google/Outlook calendar sync, though not explicitly documented. Serra provides 24/7 Slack support for customers[8] (customer service), but there’s no evidence of Slack/Teams being used as an integration for candidate workflow. (Zapier/API connectors are not mentioned publicly.)

Compliance: We found no public attestations or certifications. Serra’s documentation does not explicitly cite GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001, or EEOC compliance. (Presumably, it must handle personal data per GDPR for EU/UK clients, but no vendor statements were found.)

Implementation: Details are scant. One customer testimonial notes “20 interviews in the first week”[9], suggesting rapid time-to-value once configured. Setup likely involves connecting the ATS and defining hiring criteria (“telling Serra your search”). No official rollout timeline; assume a typical SaaS onboarding (days–weeks) for account setup, ATS sync, and agent calibration. Potential bottlenecks include the quality of ATS data and tuning the AI to specific roles.

Strategic Positioning

Differentiation: Serra’s key differentiator is its AI-driven end-to-end approach. It builds a vector-based search over ~1B candidate profiles (LinkedIn, Indeed, GitHub, Crunchbase, plus your ATS) and ranks them with explainable summaries[10][2]. Uniquely, Serra can leverage the company’s own employee network: it “uses your team’s combined network… to find the right people and who can intro you to them”[11]. Beyond sourcing, Serra automates personalized multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn) and even continues the conversation to qualify candidates[7][12]. Users report finding candidates not visible on LinkedIn or other tools, and higher reply rates on warm vs. cold outreach. Testimonials emphasize that Serra “surfacing candidates better than LinkedIn Recruiter or Gem”[13].

Ideal Customer: Geared toward in-house recruiting teams at fast-growing companies (the 50–500 employee range). Tech-savvy mid-market or enterprise firms (e.g. YC cites users like Waymo, Verkada, Replit) benefit most[14]. These companies have recruiting volume justifying AI automation. It’s less positioned for small businesses with manual processes or for external staffing agencies.

Competitive Landscape: Direct peers include other AI recruiting assistants. Pin (pin.com) is a similar 24/7 AI recruiter: it searches ~850M+ profiles and manages multichannel outreach (email, LinkedIn, SMS) with team inbox and scheduling[15]. Tezi (tezi.ai) offers an “agentic” AI recruiter (“Max”) that autonomously sources, screens, and schedules, notably via a Slack chatbot interface. Other alternatives include CRM/outreach tools like Gem and talent search engines like AmazingHiring. Compared to these, Serra’s niche is deep ATS integration and internal network referrals, while Pin emphasizes broad outreach (SMS/multi-company), and Tezi emphasizes a conversational AI agent approach.
