Clado – AI-Native People Search for Talent Intelligence

Company Background

Clado is a Y Combinator-backed startup founded in 2025 by Eric Mao and Tom Zheng (YC Spring 2025 batch)[1]. The company, based in San Francisco with a small team (~7 employees as of 2025), set out to reinvent people search for recruiting and sales. The founders were college freshmen when they launched Clado, drawing on personal frustrations with outdated alumni networks and traditional search tools. Y Combinator describes Clado’s mission as “deep research for people,” highlighting that finding the right talent or lead was historically “broken” – reliant on endless filter menus, incomplete data sets, and keyword searches. Clado’s emergence in 2025, with seed backing from YC, positions it at the forefront of a new generation of AI-driven talent intelligence platforms.

Platform Overview and Data

Clado offers an AI-native people search platform (called Clado Atlas) that enables users to search across a massive global talent graph of profiles. Under the hood, Clado has aggregated 800M+ people profiles and over 60 billion records, including hundreds of millions of emails and social links, to form unified “Clado Profiles” for individuals[2]. These profiles merge data from sources like LinkedIn, GitHub, Google Scholar, Twitter, and more, providing a 360° view of a person’s professional presence. Unlike traditional tools that might only search a single site or a limited database, Clado’s global talent graph is continually growing (it mapped alumni networks of 2,000+ colleges in the U.S. and is expanding globally). The platform’s front-end (Atlas) presents a simple search bar for users to input queries, and a back-end that transforms those queries into powerful search operations. Results come with rich detail – each result links to the person’s LinkedIn and other socials, and can include current role, skills, education, and more, thanks to Clado’s profile enrichment. In essence, Clado serves as a consolidated talent database with “ground-truth” information on people, far beyond what a single professional network alone contains.

AI-Powered “Agentic” Search Capabilities

At the heart of Clado is its agentic search technology – an AI-native approach that diverges from keyword matching. When you enter a natural language prompt, Clado “spawns thousands of AI agents” that each evaluate profiles in parallel to decide if they match your criteria. This means the platform uses large-scale LLM inference to interpret the query context and scan the entire 800M+ profile index intelligently. Y Combinator partner Pete Koomen explains that Clado doesn’t rely on simple similarity or Boolean logic; instead, it performs massively parallel reasoning on profiles using specialized AI agents. For the user, this yields a few big advantages:

Natural Language Queries: Recruiters can “just describe the qualities you want” in plain English (e.g. “AI engineers interested in biology in Copenhagen”), and Clado’s agents will handle translating that into a search. There’s no need to master complex Boolean strings or fiddle with dozens of filters – the AI understands intent and nuance.

Semantic Matching: Clado’s agents grasp context like job roles, skills relationships, and career progression. For example, a prompt asking for “software engineers who worked on autonomous vehicles at Tesla and now are at Meta” would require understanding past vs. current employers and domain expertise. Clado’s multi-agent system can interpret these facets and find profiles that fit the concept even if specific keywords aren’t all present. This semantic profile matching surfaces candidates that traditional keyword search might miss.

LLM-Powered Filtering: The platform effectively acts as an AI filter on top of its big database. After the initial wide crawl, the agents validate and score each profile’s relevance to the prompt. The output is a curated list of results with an explanation of why each profile was selected, providing transparency. (Notably, each result in Clado comes with a short AI-generated blurb summarizing why that person matched the criteria – this helps recruiters quickly assess fit without manual vetting of every profile.)

Massive Parallelism for Speed: Clado deploys “10^5+” (hundreds of thousands of) agents simultaneously. Practically, this means even very complex searches execute in a short time. In a hands-on example, a highly specific prompt involving multiple filters (education year, location, past and current companies, project domain) returned results “within a couple of minutes” and saved hours of manual work. The heavy lifting – what used to be a researcher manually narrowing down – is now offloaded to AI at scale.

These AI-native capabilities differentiate Clado by making the search process autonomous and intelligent. Rather than showing you 1,000+ loosely filtered results and forcing you to narrow them, Clado’s AI aims to deliver a concise set of top matches that truly fit the nuanced criteria. This agentic approach has been benchmarked against other tools: in an Elo-style ranking of search quality, Clado outscored peers (including Pearch, Exa, Juicebox’s PeopleGPT, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator) on returning relevant results, underscoring its state-of-the-art performance in AI-driven search.

Key Workflows and Use Cases

Clado is designed to support several core talent intelligence workflows end-to-end: sourcing, profile enrichment, and even elements of outreach and monitoring. Below are the practical ways in-house Talent Acquisition teams (as well as sales or VC users) are leveraging Clado:

Candidate Sourcing (AI Search): A recruiter or sourcing lead begins by entering a description of the ideal candidate. For example: “Find senior TypeScript engineers who have led front-end architecture in fintech startups.” Clado’s engine processes this prompt and returns a tailored list of candidates who meet these specifics (with each candidate’s current title, company, location, etc.). Users report that highly complex queries which would be “time-consuming to execute with standard filtering tools” can be handled in minutes by Clado. Recruiters particularly appreciate that they can find the best possible candidates in minutes even for tricky, cross-cutting criteria. This dramatically shortens the sourcing phase.

Profile Enrichment (Contact & Details): Once you have a list of target profiles, Clado can enrich them with contact info and additional data with one click. Every result in Clado comes with a LinkedIn URL by default, and using the enrichment feature will fetch available personal or work emails, phone numbers, GitHub accounts, Google Scholar profiles, and more. Clado prides itself on state-of-the-art email retrieval, claiming it can find correct emails at a success rate 3× higher than popular providers. For recruiters, this means you immediately get actionable contact info instead of just a name – critical for outreach. For example, given a LinkedIn profile, Clado will retrieve emails (often both corporate and personal) if available. This saves the step of using a separate tool or InMail. According to Clado, it has over 640 million emails in its data stores to draw from. Usage tip: you can enrich in bulk as well, generating a list of thousands of leads with emails “with a few clicks on Clado Atlas”.

Outreach Preparation: While Clado itself isn’t an email sequencing tool, it accelerates outreach by producing ready-to-use leads. By integrating Clado’s results with your email or CRM system, a recruiter can quickly move to personalized messaging. Notably, Clado’s API can directly feed enriched profiles into outreach workflows (for instance, exporting a CSV of contacts or via integration). Some next-gen platforms (like Juicebox PeopleGPT or Pin) bundle automated outreach, but Clado focuses on finding and enriching the contacts so that your team can then reach out via email, LinkedIn, etc., using your preferred channels. There’s also anecdotal evidence that quality of Clado’s results improves outreach efficiency: one customer noted their “time-to-interview decreased by over 30%” after using Clado, because the candidates found were highly relevant and more likely to convert.

Talent Pipeline Augmentation (ATS/CRM enrichment): Clado can be used to augment existing candidate databases in an ATS or CRM. In-house TA teams often have pools of past applicants or silver medalist candidates with incomplete info. Using Clado’s enrichment, you could take a list of LinkedIn profile URLs (or even just names that you then resolve to profiles via Clado) and enrich them with updated roles, emails, and other social data. This brings stale records to life and helps recruiters reconnect with candidates. Conversely, after finding new candidates on Clado, teams can push them into the ATS along with their contact details. While Clado doesn’t yet advertise native one-click ATS integrations, its open API and export features make it feasible to load Clado-sourced candidates into systems like Greenhouse or Lever with a bit of workflow setup. This essentially turns Clado into an AI-powered feeder for your internal talent pipeline.

“Monitors” and Alerts: A unique feature aimed at venture and sourcing use cases is Clado’s ability to set up monitors for certain criteria. Venture capital users, for instance, use Clado to find startup founders meeting specific criteria and can get notified when new profiles appear that match (e.g. a founder with a certain background starting a new company). For recruiting, one could imagine setting a monitor for, say, “UX designers at FAANG companies who switched jobs in the last month” to catch potential passive candidates early. This proactive alerting turns sourcing into a continuous process – Clado’s agents keep an eye out and update you, rather than you having to rerun searches manually.

Overall, Clado’s workflows allow a sourcing leader to go from a broad hiring idea to a curated list of candidates with emails in hand, in a single platform. This covers the gamut of sourcing: intelligent search, data enrichment, and preparation for outreach – significantly reducing the manual effort at each step. Recruiters and sourcers who have used Clado note that it “brings back top-quality candidates automatically”, essentially acting as an AI sourcing assistant that does the heavy lifting for you.

Integration and Implementation

Clado is delivered as a cloud-based SaaS platform (the Atlas web app) and also provides a developer-friendly API. Onboarding and setup are minimal – users can sign up for a free trial account (with some free credits included) and start searching immediately in the web interface (no lengthy implementation needed). The UI is designed to be intuitive: just a search bar and results page, which is a low learning curve compared to enterprise tools. In fact, Clado’s usability is often praised; it replaces dozens of complex filters with a simple prompt-driven UX, making it very “intuitive” and easy to use (rated “Very High” ease-of-use). Training a recruiting team on Clado likely involves just learning to craft good search prompts, which is a quick skill to pick up (and Clado provides example queries to help new users).

For teams that want to integrate Clado into existing systems or workflows, the Clado Search & Enrichment API is available with comprehensive documentation. The API allows programmatic access to all key functions: - People Search API: Submit natural language queries via API and get back structured JSON of profile results. This can enable custom internal tools or integrations (for example, integrating Clado search into your internal talent CRM interface). - Deep Research jobs: For very broad searches, the API supports asynchronous “deep research” jobs that deploy the agent swarm and return results asynchronously, which is useful if you want to retrieve thousands of results without timing out. - Enrichment API: Endpoints to get contact info (email/phone) for a given LinkedIn profile, to scrape full profile data, and even to analyze LinkedIn post engagement. This means you could, say, pipe a list of LinkedIn URLs from your ATS into Clado’s enrichment API and populate emails and phone numbers in your database automatically. Bulk enrichment is supported as well for batch jobs.

Integration potential: While Clado doesn’t yet list out-of-the-box plugins for specific ATS or CRM systems (e.g. Greenhouse, Workday, Lever), the presence of a robust API and a Zapier-friendly REST approach means integration is feasible. A Zapier connector isn’t publicly mentioned yet, but an organization could use Zapier or similar middleware to trigger Clado API calls (for instance, automatically enrich a candidate when they are added to a certain ATS stage). Additionally, Clado’s roadmap hints at deeper workflow integrations: industry analysts predict seamless two-way integrations with CRMs and outreach tools as a logical next step for Clado. In practice, early-adopter teams have been integrating Clado manually by exporting CSVs or via scripts that call the API. Given Clado’s usage-based model and open approach, it can act as an on-demand “talent data engine” feeding into your existing systems.

It’s worth noting that Clado is a web application accessible in any modern browser, and as of now there isn’t a publicly known Chrome extension for Clado (unlike some competitors that have LinkedIn scraper extensions). Clado’s philosophy is to reduce reliance on manual LinkedIn browsing by doing everything in Atlas. That said, a browser extension is not critical since the platform already sources directly from the underlying data. Implementation effort for Clado is therefore low – you can get started quickly via the web app – and it can remain a standalone tool or be integrated more deeply through API when needed.

Pricing Model

Clado employs a transparent usage-based pricing model with a credit system, which is a departure from the high, fixed subscription fees typical of recruiting tools. Each credit equals $0.01 USD (about £0.008 GBP), and different actions consume a certain number of credits. You “pay for what you use” – scaling costs up or down based on activity, which can be cost-efficient for teams that want flexibility. Clado offers a free trial (with a bundle of free credits, e.g. 50 credits) to let new users try the core features. After that, you purchase credits as needed (or potentially subscribe to a plan that includes credit packs).

The pricing breakdown (as of late 2025) is roughly: 1 credit per result returned for AI-powered search, and fixed credits for certain enrichments. For example: - Running a search query with advanced AI filtering costs 1 credit per profile result. If your search returns 30 high-quality candidates, that’s 30 credits (~$0.30, or £0.24). If you instead run a simpler search without the AI agent filtering (an option advanced_filtering=false), it’s a flat 5 credits ($0.05) regardless of result count, but that mode is less powerful. Most users will use the AI mode for precision. - Contact info enrichment: Finding an email for a profile costs 4 credits ($0.04, ~£0.032) if successful, and finding a phone number costs 10 credits ($0.10, ~£0.08). If you request both and only one is found, you’re only charged for what you get (e.g. 4 credits if only email comes back). In practice, an email + phone together might be 14 credits ($0.14) if both are found for a person. - Scraping a full LinkedIn profile (education, experience, etc.) costs 2 credits ($0.02), which is useful if you need to pull structured profile data into a database. - The heavy Deep Research agent jobs also cost 1 credit per result found, similar to search. So if a deep search yields 500 results, that’s 500 credits ($5.00).

To put this in perspective in GBP: finding 100 candidate emails might cost ~£3.20, and a typical detailed search that yields 50 candidates might cost ~£0.40. This model is highly transparent – the docs openly list the credit cost of each action, so users can predict costs easily. It contrasts with competitors like LinkedIn Recruiter or SeekOut which often charge hefty monthly or annual license fees regardless of actual usage. For example, LinkedIn Recruiter Corporate can run into hundreds of pounds per month per seat (often ~$70–$150 per month per user for various plans in the market). Clado, by using pay-as-you-go pricing, can be more cost-effective, especially for teams that have sporadic hiring bursts or smaller constant needs.

However, buyers should consider their usage patterns: Clado’s credit model could become costly for very broad searches that return thousands of results if one isn’t careful. The flip side is that such broad searches would also be unwieldy to manually handle; Clado encourages more targeted querying. Many talent teams may find that even after accounting for generous usage, Clado’s model comes out cheaper than maintaining multiple LinkedIn seats or contracts with data providers. Plus, the model scales up or down with your hiring activity – you’re not locked into paying for a slow hiring month. Enterprise and high-volume users can likely negotiate custom pricing or bulk credit packages as well. Overall, Clado’s pricing is transparent and usage-driven, aligning cost with actual value received (a refreshing approach in a space where pricing is often opaque).

(All prices in USD have been converted to GBP at roughly 1 USD ≈ 0.8 GBP for reference.)

Security and Compliance

Dealing with personal data on millions of individuals means Clado must prioritize security and compliance. The company has publicly committed to enterprise-grade security practices, and has obtained SOC 2 Type I certification (common for SaaS startups handling sensitive data). Furthermore, Clado is in the observation period for SOC 2 Type II compliance as of 2025, indicating that they are undergoing the rigorous process to verify operational security controls over time. They also align with ISO/IEC 27001:2025 standards for information security management, and use industry-standard encryption (SSL/TLS for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest). For a TA leader, these certifications and practices should provide confidence that Clado is handling data responsibly and protecting your searches and exported candidate data.

On the compliance front, GDPR and other privacy regulations are highly relevant when working with EU candidate data. While Clado’s website and documentation don’t explicitly mention GDPR compliance, it’s implied that as a data processor of public personal data, Clado must adhere to such regulations. Likely measures include honoring opt-out or deletion requests (if an individual wanted their data removed), and ensuring any EU-origin data is processed with a lawful basis (Clado primarily uses public web data like LinkedIn profiles, which typically falls under legitimate interest use for recruitment, but companies using Clado in the EU should still include it in their GDPR data processing inventories). As a UK-based TA leader, one should inquire about Clado’s stance on UK GDPR and ensure a Data Processing Agreement is in place if needed.

Clado’s emphasis on compliance is also seen in its messaging: “We push the frontier without compromising trust”. They understand that using AI on people data comes with ethical responsibilities regarding privacy and bias. There haven’t been public red flags about misuse of data, and given their YC backing and enterprise ambitions, Clado is incentivized to stay on the right side of compliance. Still, due diligence is recommended: confirm how Clado sources its data (likely from public web profiles and third-party data partners) and how individuals can exercise their rights. From a data security perspective, the SOC2 and encryption show a proactive stance. From a privacy perspective, we anticipate Clado will comply with frameworks like GDPR/CCPA, though formal attestations (e.g., EU-US DPA arrangements) should be confirmed in a security review.

In summary, Clado appears to be enterprise-ready in security (SOC2 audited, encryption, etc.) and is mindful of compliance. This is crucial if you operate in a regulated industry or handle candidate data that must be protected. Always treat any tool like Clado as you would a data vendor – ensure it meets your company’s compliance requirements – but Clado’s early moves in security compliance are a positive signal.

Competitive Landscape

Clado sits at the intersection of two groups of competitors: traditional people search platforms (like LinkedIn Recruiter, SeekOut, HireEZ) and next-gen AI-driven sourcing tools (like Juicebox’s PeopleGPT, Pin, Tezi, etc.). Understanding how Clado compares will clarify its unique value:

Versus Traditional Platforms (LinkedIn Recruiter, SeekOut, HireEZ): Traditional sourcing tools rely heavily on Boolean keywords and filter-based UIs. For example, LinkedIn Recruiter allows filtering by title, company, location, etc., but it struggles with nuanced queries (and often you need complex Boolean strings for anything specific). Clado’s big differentiator is the conversational search: you don’t need to know the exact title or boolean syntax – just describe the candidate, and Clado finds them. This makes advanced sourcing accessible to non-experts and vastly speeds up expert sourcers’ workflow[3]. Additionally, LinkedIn’s data is limited to what users put on their profiles (and LinkedIn’s own 900M user base with varying activity levels). Clado casts a wider net (800M profiles from multiple sources) and can find people who might not be active on LinkedIn or who have additional footprints (GitHub, personal sites, etc.). Data completeness is a strength of SeekOut and HireEZ as well – they aggregate profiles and contacts – but those still use filter-driven search UIs. Clado outperforms on search quality and nuance, achieving what one user called “probably the best tool I’ve used” for finding top-quality candidates without manual sourcing.

In terms of accuracy, Clado’s AI validation means fewer false positives. A LinkedIn Recruiter search might throw up a lot of noise (requiring manual sifting), whereas Clado’s results are curated by relevance score. One testimonial noted Clado is “able to find people better than anyone else” in complex queries. SeekOut offers AI-assisted search too (they introduced some NLP search features and have very rich filters, including diversity filters and inferred security clearances), so the gap is narrower there. But Clado’s fully agentic approach likely yields more precise results on highly complex multi-criteria searches, whereas SeekOut might require combining several filters and still not reach the same level of semantic understanding. On the user experience front: LinkedIn’s interface is considered clunky and time-consuming for sourcing (as many sourcers attest)[4], whereas Clado’s is streamlined.

Contact info is another differentiator. LinkedIn provides InMail as a way to reach candidates (or email via Recruiter if the candidate enabled it), but no direct personal email discovery. HireEZ and SeekOut do provide emails/phone number finds; Clado competes directly here and claims higher accuracy (3× better email finding than other providers). Clado’s contact data performance is considered state-of-the-art, which likely rivals or exceeds HireEZ’s capabilities. Pricing-wise, as discussed, Clado’s usage model can be more flexible vs. the often enterprise-contract nature of SeekOut or LinkedIn. In fact, an industry comparison chart shows Clado as usage-based vs LinkedIn Recruiter at ~$70–99 per month per seat and SeekOut/HireEZ typically in the similar subscription range. For a team that’s cost-sensitive or variable in hiring needs, Clado offers potential savings.

Versus Next-Gen AI Sourcing Tools (PeopleGPT by Juicebox, Pin, Tezi, etc.): This new wave of tools all leverage AI in some form, but with different focuses. Juicebox’s PeopleGPT is perhaps the closest analog to Clado: it also allows natural language people search and claims a similarly large index (~800M profiles). PeopleGPT’s value prop is very similar – “type what you’re looking for” and get results. One key difference users have noted is in the execution: Clado uses its own multi-agent system and seems to emphasize result quality and enrichment, whereas PeopleGPT is described as a UI layer over something akin to GPT search – powerful, but some found it equivalent to “ChatGPT on your own data” without as much secret sauce. Clado’s benchmark (as cited on its site) actually compared itself to Juicebox and showed a higher Elo score in search relevance. Both likely use LLMs; Clado’s approach of many specialized agents might give it an edge in complex logic. Juicebox, on the other hand, has more built-out features around engagement – for instance, it can craft outreach messages and sequences, learning from replies to improve engagement rates. Clado doesn’t automate outreach content; it focuses on delivering the data so your team can do personalized outreach. So if a TA leader’s priority is automating engagement, a tool like PeopleGPT or Pin might offer more on that front, but if the priority is finding the right people with high precision, Clado excels. In practice, some teams might even use Clado for search and then use another tool or internal process for outreach.

Pin is another next-gen competitor that goes further into automation. Pin markets itself as a “24/7 AI recruiting assistant” and can handle an entire requisition: you feed it a job description and it will not only find candidates (from ~850M profiles) but also send outreach messages and schedule interviews autonomously. Pin’s strength is end-to-end automation – sourcing, multi-channel outreach (email/LinkedIn/SMS) with follow-ups, and even calendar scheduling, essentially acting like a virtual sourcer+coordinator. Pin’s reported success metrics are high (e.g. 48% candidate response rates to its AI outreach, 70% of contacted candidates entering pipelines). Compared to Clado, Pin is a broader solution for teams that want to offload as much recruiting work as possible to an AI agent. The trade-off is control and specialization: Pin’s search capability is also AI-driven, but it may not allow the same level of direct, fine-grained searching that Clado gives a sourcer. Clado is a tool that augment a recruiter (finding great leads fast), whereas Pin tries to replace some recruiter tasks (you give it a job spec and it runs with it). They target slightly different use cases: Clado is ideal if you still want a human in the loop to select and engage candidates, while Pin is for when you want automation to handle high-volume sourcing and outreach hands-free. Some organizations might even use Clado for niche searches and Pin for volume roles.

Tezi is another emerging platform, focusing on an autonomous recruiting agent named “Max” that not only sources but also screens and schedules – it’s more akin to Pin in aiming to automate the recruiting workflow end-to-end. Tezi is targeted at founders or small teams that lack recruiting staff, letting the AI agent handle tedious parts. Thus, Tezi and Pin are more full-service AI recruiters; Clado is more a specialized talent search and intelligence tool.

In summary, Clado’s strategic positioning is as an AI-powered sourcing and intelligence platform that can slot into a recruiter’s toolkit (or a sourcing team’s workflow) to dramatically improve how they find and research people. Its key differentiators are the power and precision of its search (agentic, LLM-driven) and the breadth+depth of its data (global profile coverage with contact enrichment). Traditional competitors can’t match the AI-driven flexibility, and while big platforms like SeekOut have huge databases, Clado matches that scale and surpasses on AI search capabilities. Next-gen competitors share some of Clado’s AI approach, but Clado distinguishes itself with a focus on search quality (backed by benchmarks) and data accuracy (SOTA enrichment). For a TA leader, this means Clado can potentially replace or supplement tools like LinkedIn Recruiter and Contact Finder add-ons, while fitting alongside internal processes. It’s not an outreach sequencer itself (so you’d still use your email tools or LinkedIn to message candidates), but it solves the hardest upstream problem: who to contact, and how to reach them, in far less time than before.

Real-World Adoption and Strategic Insights

Clado’s traction and early customer feedback illustrate its impact in real recruiting scenarios. Since launching in early 2025, Clado rapidly grew to over 80,000 users by mid-2025 – a notable adoption rate that suggests strong market fit. Many of these users took advantage of Clado’s free trial and found value quickly. Clado has also begun working with companies on large-scale projects, delivering “curated lists of 100,000+ people” for their sales or recruiting needs. This indicates that even enterprise clients are testing its limits for big talent mapping initiatives.

Customer testimonials provide proof points: - Bolto (YC S23 startup) reported that “Clado is probably the best tool I’ve used” when measuring candidate quality vs. time spent. Their Growth lead noted they no longer spend time manually sourcing – Clado’s automation finds top-quality candidates without manual effort. This speaks to significant efficiency gains. - Terac (another startup) shared that Clado’s search and enrichment improved their time-to-interview by 30% by finding better candidates faster. Reducing time-to-interview is critical for in-house TA teams trying to speed up hiring cycles, and Clado directly contributed to that acceleration for this customer. - On the investor side, a YC Partner publicly praised Clado’s approach: “They’ve built a powerful people search engine using massively parallel LLM inference…Clado spawns thousands of agents…rather than rely on keyword search.”. This endorsement highlights that experts see Clado’s tech as truly novel in the recruiting space. - On social media (the “Wall of Love”), recruiting and startup professionals have commented how Clado “makes people search so much easier” and even “changed my hiring funnel forever”. Such anecdotes suggest that once teams incorporate Clado, it fundamentally improves their sourcing funnel efficiency.

For a talent acquisition leader evaluating modern sourcing tools, a few strategic insights emerge from Clado’s case:

Paradigm Shift – From Manual Filters to Delegated AI: Clado exemplifies the shift in recruiting from labor-intensive Boolean hunting to AI-assisted discovery. As one analysis put it, it moves sourcing from “tedious, manual filtering to intelligent, delegated research”, allowing recruiters to focus on engaging candidates rather than finding them. This aligns with the broader trend in TA: those who leverage AI will free up time for high-value human tasks (relationship building, closing) while AI handles the grunt work[5][6]. Adopting Clado can be a competitive advantage, enabling your team to source better talent faster than rivals stuck on legacy methods.

Quality vs. Quantity: Traditional sourcing often yields a high quantity of candidates that then require heavy filtering for quality. Clado flips this, aiming to give a high-quality short list from the start. Strategically, this can improve downstream metrics like candidate experience (contacting only truly relevant people) and recruiter productivity. An internal sourcing leader should measure if Clado’s candidates advance further in pipeline on average – early anecdotes suggest they do, due to better fit. If so, Clado is not just saving time but also improving hiring outcomes by focusing efforts on the right talent.

Cost-Benefit: With Clado’s pay-per-use model, strategic budgeting is easier to justify. You might calculate, for example, that sourcing X roles via Clado credits costs significantly less than a LinkedIn Recruiter license or an external agency fee would. And because it’s scalable, you could pilot Clado on a tough req or two and visibly show faster results or pipeline improvement, building the case to integrate it broadly. The transparency in pricing also means you can closely track ROI – e.g., £50 in Clado credits yielded 200 enriched leads and resulted in 5 hires, which is a compelling story to finance stakeholders. In contrast, many traditional tools are sunk costs regardless of results.

Integration into TA Stack: Clado doesn’t necessarily replace all tools; it can augment your ATS and LinkedIn usage. A strategic approach might be to use Clado for what it’s best at (deep, broad people search and contact finding) and then utilize LinkedIn for the final outreach step or use your CRM to nurture candidates. Over time, if Clado continues to expand features (the roadmap might bring more CRM or outreach integrations), it could consolidate more of the workflow. As of now, TA leaders should view Clado as a sourcing intelligence layer to plug in. It could also empower junior recruiters or sourcers to perform like seasoned Boolean experts, leveling up the whole team’s capability without extensive training.

Ideal Use Cases & Company Fit: Clado is particularly valuable for organizations that hire for hard-to-fill or highly specific roles, where traditional search is like finding a needle in a haystack. For example, tech startups searching for niche engineering talent, or a biotech firm seeking AI experts with biology background – Clado shines in those scenarios (as evidenced by the complex prompt examples it handles). Internal sourcing teams at mid-to-large companies can use Clado to complement their LinkedIn sourcing, especially for diversity sourcing, competitive talent mapping, and building talent pools in new markets/geographies. Small companies or agencies with limited LinkedIn seats might use Clado to stretch their reach without buying more licenses. Since Clado can scale down to one-off searches, even a small HR team could use it ad-hoc for a few key hires. Conversely, large enterprises with sourcing teams could integrate Clado into daily workflow for global searches. We also see use in non-recruiting domains like sales (for lead generation) and VC (for founder search), which hints at Clado’s versatility across any people-search domain.

In conclusion, Clado represents a cutting-edge tool in the talent sourcing toolkit – one that harnesses AI to tackle the fundamental challenge of who to reach out to for a given opportunity. It differentiates itself by delivering not just data, but actionable intelligence: telling you who the right people are and providing the means to contact them. Early results show significant efficiency gains and successful hires attributable to the platform. For talent acquisition leaders, adopting Clado (or a similar AI sourcing platform) could be a strategic move to stay ahead in the race for talent. It allows your team to spend less time on search drudgery and more time engaging and interviewing the best candidates – ultimately improving both the speed and quality of hires. Given its YC pedigree, rapid innovation is expected from Clado, so it’s a tool to watch (and trial) as the recruitment technology landscape continues to evolve towards AI-driven solutions. Clado’s value proposition to TA: more strategic sourcing, less grunt work, and a pipeline filled with precisely targeted talent – all delivered by an AI co-pilot that learns and scales with your needs. It’s an example of how embracing AI in recruiting can transform talent acquisition from a hunting exercise into a smart, data-driven matchmaking process.
