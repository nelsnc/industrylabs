## HOW THIS DOCUMENT WORKS

### Update Workflow

**You don't manually fill this log. Instead:**

1. **Weekly Review Conversation** (Every Friday):
    - You: "Here's what I decided this week: [describe decisions]"
    - Claude: Extracts decisions, assigns impact level, formats them, adds DEC numbers
    - Claude: **Shows formatted entries and waits for your approval**
    - You: "Approved - update the log" (or request changes)
    - Claude: **In next response**, adds to document
2. **Monthly Outcome Review** (Last Sunday of month):
    - You: Share this document + "Update outcomes for decisions made 1-3 months ago"
    - Claude: Lists decisions needing review, asks what happened
    - Claude: **Shows updated outcomes and waits for approval**
    - You: "Approved - update the log"
    - Claude: **In next response**, updates document
3. **Quarterly Pattern Analysis** (End of Month 3, 6, 9, 12):
    - You: Share document + "Analyze decision patterns"
    - Claude: Analyzes patterns, focuses on High Impact decisions
    - Claude: **Shows analysis and waits for approval**
    - You: "Approved - update the log"
    - Claude: **In next response**, updates document

**Your job**: Describe decisions in conversation

**Claude's job**: Format, number, assign impact level - but only update after your explicit approval in a new response

## DECISION CLASSIFICATION GUIDE (FOR CLAUDE)

### Format Selection: Full vs Mini

**Simple rule**: Does this decision change **what** you're doing (strategy, business model, value prop, core features)? → **Full Format**  
Does it change **how** you execute existing strategy? → **Mini Format**

**Full Format** (Strategic):
- Pricing or business model changes
- Target market, ICP, or positioning changes
- Core product features that define value prop
- Technology platform decisions
- Vertical expansion or market entry
- Major pivots or strategic reversals

**Mini Format** (Tactical):
- Process, workflow, or operational changes
- Resource allocation or time management
- Feature prioritization within existing roadmap
- Tool or platform selection within existing stack
- Content approach or social media strategy
- Vendor outreach tactics

**When unsure**: Ask user "Should this be Full or Mini format?"

---

### Impact Level Assignment

**Claude assigns Impact Level automatically based on this framework:**

**High Impact** = Changes foundational business elements:
- **Business model**: Pricing structure, revenue model, monetization approach
- **Market position**: ICP, target geography, competitive positioning
- **Core value prop**: Features that define "what we sell" (Request Board, Editorial Picks)
- **Platform decisions**: Technology choices that are costly to reverse (Softr → custom)
- **Strategic direction**: Vertical selection, market entry/exit, major pivots

**Medium Impact** = Changes execution approach with measurable consequences:
- **Workflow/process**: How content is produced, vendor outreach sequencing
- **Resource allocation**: Time split, budget priorities, hiring decisions
- **Tactical approach**: Email templates, content types, social media strategy
- **Tool selection**: Choosing between Notion/Airtable within existing workflow
- **Feature scope**: Building X before Y within existing product vision

**Low Impact** = Operational adjustments, easily reversible:
- **Routine optimization**: Page load speed, image compression
- **Cosmetic changes**: UI colors, button text, layout tweaks
- **Administrative**: Meeting schedules, documentation formatting
- **Minor tactical**: Posting frequency, email send times

**Key test**: "If this decision fails, how much needs to change?"
- Entire strategy/business model = **High**
- Execution approach in one area = **Medium**
- Just this one thing = **Low**

**User can override**: If user specifies different impact level, always use their judgment.

## CURRENT DECISIONS

---

### FOUNDATIONAL DECISIONS (Pre-Launch Phase - November 2025)

The following 10 decisions document core strategic choices made during the planning phase, before execution began. They were consolidated from Master Plan v1.0 and represent the foundational assumptions for Year 1.

These decisions all use **Full Format** and are all **High Impact** because they define core strategy, business model, and product approach.`

## **DEC-001 (UPDATED): Build custom platform using Next.js instead of Softr**

**Date**: 2025-11-19

**Impact**: High

**Tags**: technical, strategy, speed-to-market, product

### **Decision**

Build the MVP using **Next.js 14 + React + Tailwind + Airtable**, instead of Softr.

### **Context**

Original plan (Nov 16) was to use Softr for rapid no-code launch.

After technical review, it became clear:

- You want to learn React long-term
- Next.js is better for SEO
- Airtable + Next.js gives full control over data
- The system isn't actually 8–10 weeks of dev (3–4 weeks suffices with AI help)

### **Rationale**

- **SEO**: Next.js server-side rendering → better indexing than Softr
- **Control**: Full custom routing, custom UX, custom components
- **Longevity**: You grow into React/Next.js as your career skill
- **Faster iteration**: React components more flexible than Softr blocks
- **Cost**: No Softr fees; Vercel free tier covers early months

### **Alternatives Considered**

- **Stay with Softr**
    
    Rejected due to poor SEO, limited control, and learning opportunity loss.
    
- **Pure React SPA**
    
    Rejected due to zero SEO and no SSR.
    
- **WordPress + plugins**
    
    Rejected due to heavy, fragile CMS ecosystem.
    

### **Expected Outcome**

- SEO-optimized content pages (/articles/[slug])
- Fully custom UI with shadcn/ui
- Faster long-term roadmap
- Better ability to scale features (Vendor Portal, analytics, etc.)

### **Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15)

[To be filled later]

`### DEC-002: Organize by industry verticals instead of generic categories (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: Vertical-first positioning (HR, L&D, CS) differentiates from horizontal competitors and enables better buyer matching.

**Decision**: Structure marketplace around industry verticals (HR, L&D, CS) rather than horizontal categories (productivity, analytics, communication)

**Context**:
- Competitive landscape dominated by generic tools (Futurepedia lists 5000+ tools across all categories)
- Buyers are overwhelmed by choice and lack context
- Enterprise buyers think in terms of "HR tools" not "productivity tools"

**Rationale**:
- **Differentiation**: Every competitor uses horizontal categories. Vertical-first is our unique positioning
- **Buyer psychology**: HR leaders search for "AI HR tools," not "AI productivity tools for various departments"
- **Better matching**: Industry context allows better Request Board matching (company size, compliance needs, use cases are industry-specific)
- **Content depth**: Can write "Best AI Tools for HR" with real expertise vs shallow "Best AI Productivity Tools" covering 10 industries
- **Network effects**: HR vendors want to be listed alongside other HR vendors, creating category cohesion

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Horizontal categories** (Productivity, Analytics, Communication): Standard approach, easier to scale initially. Rejected because no differentiation from competitors
- **Hybrid** (both vertical and horizontal): Confusing navigation, dilutes positioning. Rejected because clarity > comprehensiveness
- **Job title focus** ("Tools for CHROs"): Too narrow, limits scalability. Rejected because verticals are broader and easier to expand

**Expected Outcome**:
- Clearer positioning in market ("The HR AI Tool Marketplace")
- Higher quality content (depth > breadth)
- Better Request Board matches (industry-specific context)
- Easier vendor sales pitch ("We're the HR tool marketplace" vs "We list all AI tools")

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Slower initial growth (focusing on one vertical vs launching with many)
- Can't list every tool immediately (only those relevant to HR)
- Must learn each vertical deeply before expanding

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

**Impact Level**: High  
**Tags**: strategy, positioning, product

### DEC-003: Target 50-500 employee companies (mid-market) (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: Mid-market focus balances budget availability, decision speed, and tool fit better than SMB or Enterprise.

**Decision**: Focus on mid-market companies (50-500 employees) rather than SMB (1-50) or Enterprise (500+)

**Context**:
- Need clear ICP for content, Request Board matching, and vendor targeting
- Different segments have vastly different needs, budgets, and buying processes
- Can't serve everyone well initially

**Rationale**:
- **Budget availability**: Mid-market has budget for tools (£500-5000/mo range), unlike SMBs who need free/cheap options
- **Decision speed**: Faster than enterprise (weeks vs months), important for validation timeline
- **Pain intensity**: Growing fast, feeling pain of manual processes, ready to invest in solutions
- **Tool fit**: Most AI tools target this segment (SMB tools too simple, enterprise tools too complex/expensive)
- **Vendor overlap**: Vendors want to reach this segment (high conversion, reasonable sales cycles)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **SMB focus (1-50 employees)**: Larger addressable market but lower budgets. Rejected because free-tier tools dominate, harder to monetize
- **Enterprise focus (500+)**: Higher deal values but slower sales cycles, complex requirements. Rejected because too slow for Year 1 validation
- **Broad (all segments)**: Diluted messaging, can't match well in Request Board. Rejected because need focus to execute well

**Expected Outcome**:
- Clear content targeting ("If you're an HR leader at a 200-person company...")
- Better tool recommendations (filter out SMB-only and enterprise-only tools)
- Vendors excited about ICP overlap
- Request Board matches lead to higher conversion (tools actually fit buyer needs)

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Smaller addressable market initially
- May need to reject some Request Board submissions ("Sorry, we focus on 50-500 employee companies")
- Some great tools excluded because they only serve SMB or Enterprise

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

**Impact Level**: High  
**Tags**: strategy, ICP

### DEC-004: Start with HR vertical before L&D and CS (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: HR-first with proven playbook for L&D (M4-5) and CS (M7-9) beats launching three mediocre verticals simultaneously.

**Decision**: Launch with HR & Talent vertical only, add L&D in Month 4-5, CS in Month 7-9

**Context**:
- Need to focus limited time (30-36 hrs/week)
- Could attempt to launch all three verticals simultaneously
- Risk of doing three things poorly vs one thing well

**Rationale**:
- **Focus**: 30-36 hours/week means depth > breadth. Better to dominate HR than be mediocre in three verticals
- **Proven template**: Launching HR successfully creates playbook for L&D and CS (same vendor outreach process, same Request Board logic, same content templates)
- **Vendor overlap**: ~70% of HR vendors also offer L&D tools → easier to upsell existing relationships when adding L&D
- **Content reuse**: Comparison article template works across all verticals, just swap tools and terminology
- **Lower risk**: If HR fails, knowing that in Month 3 is better than discovering all three verticals fail in Month 6

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Launch all three simultaneously**: Faster coverage but 3x the work with same time budget. Rejected because quality would suffer across all three
- **Start with L&D**: Smaller market than HR. Rejected because HR has more tools, more buyers, more validation signal
- **Start with CS**: Crowded market (Zendesk, Intercom dominate). Rejected because harder differentiation

**Expected Outcome**:
- HR vertical fully built by Week 12 (20-30 tools, 5-8 articles, Request Board functional)
- 5-8 paying HR vendors by Month 3 (validates business model)
- HR playbook documented, ready to replicate for L&D
- Month 4-5: Add L&D in 3-4 weeks (using HR playbook)
- Month 7-9: Add CS in 3-4 weeks

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Slower initial growth (can't capture L&D/CS buyers immediately)
- Some vendors might say "call us when you have L&D" (acceptable, come back later)
- Competitors might launch multi-vertical before we do (acceptable, we'll have better depth)

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

**Impact Level**: High  
**Tags**: strategy, vertical-expansion, focus

### DEC-005: Premium pricing at £99/month per vertical (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: £99/mo per vertical (not per tool, not per company) balances affordability with expansion revenue.

**Decision**: Premium vendor tier priced at £99/month per vertical (not per tool, not per company)

**Context**:
- Need to determine pricing model before vendor outreach begins
- Competitors charge anywhere from £200-2000/month
- Early-stage platform with zero traction

**Rationale**:
- **Per-vertical pricing aligns incentives**: Vendor pays for each vertical they want featured in (HR, L&D, CS). If they have tools in multiple verticals, they pay multiple subscriptions
- **Affordable barrier to entry**: £99/mo is impulse-buy territory for mid-market vendors. Don't need exec approval, marketing manager can decide
- **Easy expansion**: When we add L&D vertical, existing HR vendors can add L&D subscription for additional £99/mo (£198/mo total)
- **Competitive positioning**: Lower than G2/Capterra (£500-2000/mo) but premium enough to be taken seriously
- **Psychological threshold**: £99 sits just under £100 psychological barrier. £120 feels more expensive despite being only 21% more

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **£49/mo**: Too cheap, vendors won't take it seriously, implies low-value platform. Rejected because positioning matters
- **£199/mo**: Cleaner number but requires more traction to justify. Rejected because too high for zero-traction platform
- **Per-tool pricing** (£99 per tool): Vendors with multiple tools pay more. Rejected because penalizes vendors with robust product suites
- **Flat £99 for all verticals**: Lost expansion revenue. Rejected because leaves money on the table

**Expected Outcome**:
- 60-70% of approached vendors say "yes" or "maybe" to £99/mo (vs 30-40% at £199/mo)
- Clear expansion path: HR-only vendor (£99) → HR+L&D vendor (£198) → HR+L&D+CS vendor (£297)
- Target Month 3: 5-8 premium vendors = £495-792 MRR
- Can always raise prices later once traction is proven (grandfather early vendors)

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Lower revenue per vendor than competitors (but higher volume potential)
- Need more vendors to hit same MRR as charging £299/mo
- Might be perceived as "budget option" (mitigated by quality of platform)

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

**Impact Level**: High  
**Tags**: pricing, business-model, monetization

### DEC-006: Early Bird offer - 3 months free for first 10 vendors (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: 3 months free (not 1 month, not 50% off) gives time to prove value while filtering tire-kickers.

**Decision**: First 10 Premium vendors receive 3 months free, then £99/mo (not 50% discount, not 1 month free)

**Context**:
- Zero traction, zero social proof, zero vendor testimonials
- Need early partners to validate platform and create case studies
- Vendors understandably skeptical of brand-new marketplace

**Rationale**:
- **Risk-free trial**: 3 months is long enough to see real results (content published, Request Board submissions received, leads delivered)
- **Commitment signal**: Not free forever - vendors who sign up expect to pay eventually, filters out tire-kickers
- **Urgency**: "First 10 only" creates FOMO and urgency to commit now
- **Case study generation**: 3 months gives us time to gather success stories and metrics to show later vendors
- **Fair exchange**: Vendors get free trial, we get early validation and testimonials

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **50% discount forever**: Leaves money on table indefinitely. Rejected because devalues product long-term
- **1 month free**: Not enough time to see results, vendors won't see value. Rejected because too short
- **Free forever for first 10**: No revenue from early partners. Rejected because need revenue signal for validation
- **No discount**: Hard to get first customers with zero proof. Rejected because too high-friction for cold start

**Expected Outcome**:
- 8-10 vendors sign up in Month 1 (capitalizing on Early Bird offer)
- Month 4: First wave of renewals (6-8 vendors convert to paying)
- Case studies from Early Bird cohort used to sell next 20 vendors
- If only 3-4 vendors sign up in Month 1, extend offer or pivot strategy

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Zero revenue for first 3 months (acceptable, validation > short-term revenue)
- Some vendors might churn after free period (acceptable, need true believers)
- Later vendors might ask for same deal (say no, Early Bird expired)

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

**Impact Level**: High  
**Tags**: pricing, go-to-market, early-adopters

### DEC-007: AI-assisted content production, not fully manual (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: AI draft (1hr) + human review (1.5hr) = 2.5hr vs 6-8hr manual, enabling 3-4 articles/week vs 1/week.

**Decision**: Use Claude/ChatGPT to generate first drafts, then human review/edit rather than writing from scratch

**Context**:
- Need 8-10 articles for SEO by end of Month 3
- Writing high-quality articles manually takes 6-8 hours each
- 30-36 hours/week total time budget (content is only one workstream)

**Rationale**:
- **Time efficiency**: AI draft (1 hour) + human review (1.5 hours) = 2.5 hours vs 6-8 hours manual. 60-70% time savings
- **Quality control**: Human review catches AI hallucinations, adds personal insights, ensures accuracy
- **Consistency**: AI maintains consistent structure and tone across articles
- **Scalability**: Can produce 3-4 articles/week with AI vs 1 article/week manual
- **Focus on high-value work**: Spend saved time on vendor outreach (higher ROI)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Fully manual writing**: Highest quality but too slow. Rejected because can't produce enough content for SEO
- **Fully AI with no review**: Fast but risky (hallucinations, inaccuracies, generic content). Rejected because quality matters
- **Hire freelance writers**: £100-300 per article. Rejected because (a) expensive, (b) need domain expertise, (c) learning curve for each writer
- **No content strategy**: Focus only on Request Board and vendor outreach. Rejected because SEO is critical long-term traffic source

**Expected Outcome**:
- Publish 8-10 articles by Month 3 (vs 3-4 if fully manual)
- Articles are 80% as good as fully manual (acceptable trade-off)
- Time saved used for vendor outreach (higher-leverage activity)
- SEO traffic starts appearing Month 4-6

**Quality Checklist for AI Content**:
- Always fact-check tool features, pricing, compliance claims
- Add Request Board insights (patterns from real submissions)
- Rewrite intro and conclusion (most important for reader)
- Verify no AI hallucinations or outdated info
- Add 3+ internal links, 2+ external links

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Articles slightly more generic than if fully manual (mitigated by human review)
- Need to develop AI prompting skills (investment upfront)
- Some sections might need heavy rewriting

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):

### DEC-008: Request Board as differentiated feature from Day 1 (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: Request Board (qualified lead matching) is core value prop, not post-launch add-on, differentiating from passive directories.

**Decision**: Launch Request Board as core product feature from Day 1, not added later as enhancement

**Context**:
- Could launch as pure directory (just tool listings)
- Request Board requires additional build time and operational overhead (manual matching initially)
- Most directories don't have buyer-to-vendor matching

**Rationale**:
- **Core differentiation**: "Qualified leads, not just passive listings" is the entire vendor value prop. Without Request Board, we're just another directory
- **Two-sided value**: Buyers get personalized recommendations, vendors get warm leads with context
- **Competitive moat**: G2/Capterra are review platforms, not lead generation. Request Board is fundamentally different
- **Pricing justification**: £99/mo makes sense for lead gen, harder to justify for passive listing
- **Data goldmine**: Request Board submissions reveal buyer pain points → informs content strategy, tool gaps, vendor needs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Directory-first, Request Board later**: Lower build complexity initially. Rejected because removes core differentiation
- **Request Board only, no directory**: Too narrow, needs tool database for matching. Rejected because buyers need to browse too
- **Charge extra for Request Board leads**: Complicates pricing. Rejected because leads should be included in Premium (all-in-one value prop)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Request Board is primary sales pitch in vendor outreach ("We send you qualified leads")
- 10-15 Request Board submissions by Month 3
- 70-80% of submissions result in successful vendor matches
- Request Board data informs content strategy (write articles about common requests)

**Operational Plan**:
- Month 0-3: Manual matching (Nelson reviews each submission, selects 2-3 tools, notifies vendors)
- Month 3-6: Semi-automated (Airtable formulas suggest matches, Nelson reviews)
- Month 6+: Mostly automated (only edge cases require manual review)

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Extra build time for Request Board form and workflow (1-2 weeks)
- Manual matching overhead initially (30 mins per submission)
- Risk that buyers don't use it (mitigated by making it prominent and easy)

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

**Impact Level**: High

### DEC-009: Three-tier listing model (Free, Premium, Editorial Picks) (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: Free (comprehensive), Premium (monetization), Editorial Picks (quality signal) balance coverage, revenue, and trust.

**Decision**: Three listing tiers - Free (all tools listed), Premium (enhanced with lead notifications), Editorial Picks (hand-curated best tools)

**Context**:
- Could do two-tier (Free vs Premium only)
- Could charge for basic listing (no free tier)
- Need balance between open listings and curated quality

**Rationale**:
- **Free tier = comprehensive coverage**: List all relevant tools for SEO and buyer trust (buyers want options)
- **Premium tier = vendor monetization**: £99/mo for enhanced features and Request Board leads
- **Editorial Picks = quality signal**: Hand-curated "best in category" builds buyer trust and creates aspiration for vendors
- **Clear upgrade path**: Free → Premium → Editorial Pick recognition

**Editorial Picks Criteria**:
- Verified listing (vendor-confirmed information)
- Strong user reviews/reputation
- Clear product-market fit for mid-market (50-500 employees)
- Responsive vendor (answers Request Board leads quickly)
- Not paid placement (editorial integrity)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Two-tier only (Free + Premium)**: Simpler but no quality signal. Rejected because buyers need curation
- **Charge for basic listing**: Excludes many tools, worse for SEO. Rejected because need comprehensive coverage
- **Premium = automatic Editorial Pick**: Removes editorial integrity. Rejected because quality matters
- **No free tier**: Vendors pay for any listing. Rejected because limits coverage and SEO

**Expected Outcome**:
- Free tier: 50-80 tools by Month 3 (comprehensive coverage)
- Premium tier: 5-8 vendors by Month 3 (paying customers)
- Editorial Picks: 10-15 tools by Month 3 (top 2-3 per category)
- Editorial Picks become aspiration for Free tier vendors ("How do I get featured?")

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Editorial Picks create extra curation work (acceptable, builds trust)
- Some vendors might be upset about not being Editorial Pick (handle with transparency about criteria)
- Free tier doesn't generate revenue directly (but helps SEO and trust)

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

### DEC-010: London, England as operating base (timezone, currency, market focus) (2025-11-16)

**Summary**: UK base with GBP pricing and GDPR-first positioning differentiates from US-focused competitors.

**Decision**: Operate from London (GMT timezone), price in GBP (£), with initial focus on UK and English-speaking markets

**Context**:
- Currently based in London
- Could price in USD and target US primarily
- Timezone affects vendor outreach and support responsiveness

**Rationale**:
- **UK market underserved**: Most AI tool marketplaces are US-focused (prices in USD, US compliance focus)
- **GDPR-first positioning**: UK/EU buyers care deeply about GDPR compliance. Being UK-based signals credibility
- **Timezone alignment**: GMT allows good overlap with both US East Coast (afternoon calls) and EU (full working day)
- **Currency clarity**: GBP pricing is transparent for UK/EU buyers (no conversion fees/confusion)
- **English-speaking market**: UK, EU, Australia, Canada all accessible

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **USD pricing, US-first**: Larger market but more competitive. Rejected because harder to differentiate
- **Dual pricing (GBP + USD)**: Operational complexity, currency fluctuation issues. Rejected because adds confusion
- **EU focus (EUR pricing)**: Smaller English-speaking market in EU. Rejected because UK market is larger
- **Remote-first, no location**: Works but loses UK market credibility. Rejected because location matters for trust

**Expected Outcome**:
- UK vendors respond better (local credibility)
- GDPR-compliant positioning resonates with UK/EU buyers
- Can serve US vendors too (most have UK presence or are Global)
- Timezone works for both continents

**Vendor Market Distribution** (expected):
- 40-50% Global (serve all markets)
- 25-30% UK-specific
- 15-20% US-specific (but many serve UK too)
- 10-15% EU-specific

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Smaller primary market than US (acceptable, less competition)
- Some US vendors might prefer USD pricing (acceptable, can convert)
- Late night calls with West Coast US vendors (manageable)

**Actual Outcome** (Review Date: 2026-02-15):
[To be filled during monthly review]

# **IMPACT LEVEL GUIDE**

Updated examples to reflect Next.js as the new core platform.

### High Impact

Examples:

- Platform decisions (Next.js vs Softr vs WordPress)
- Pricing structure
- Market positioning
- Vertical selection
- Core features (Request Board, Editorial Picks)

### Medium Impact

Examples:

- Content workflow changes
- Outreach cadence changes
- Email templates
- Building Feature A before Feature B

### Low Impact

Examples:

- UI color changes
- Image optimization
- Scheduling routines

# **INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE (UPDATED)**

Added to the “Core Workflow Rules” section:

### **Platform decisions are ALWAYS High Impact**

Because they fundamentally change:

- SEO
- Architecture
- Development workflow
- Roadmap pacing
- Feature flexibility
- Vendor Portal feasibility

This is now explicitly stated for clarity.

`### When User Requests Decision Capture

**User says**: "Here are decisions I made this week: [descriptions]"

**Your process**:

**Step 1 - Extract and Format** (First response):
1. Extract each decision from user's description
2. Determine format: Strategy/business model/value prop change → Full Format. Execution change → Mini Format
3. Assign Impact Level using the decision test: "If this fails, what needs to change?" (Everything=High, Some things=Medium, Just this=Low)
4. Assign next DEC number: 
   - Check highest existing DEC number in document
   - Add 1 to get next number
   - **DEC numbers are permanent** - never reuse or reorder
5. Format each decision using appropriate template
6. Use tags from standard tag list only
7. Show formatted entries to user
8. Explain your reasoning for format and impact level choices
9. **End with**: "Do you approve these entries? If yes, reply 'Approved - update the log' and I'll add them in my next response."

**Step 2 - Update Document** (Second response, only after approval):
1. User says "Approved - update the log" (or similar)
2. Add formatted decisions under "EXECUTION PHASE DECISIONS" section
3. Use reverse chronological order (newest DEC number first)
4. Confirm: "Added DEC-XXX, DEC-YYY to Decision Log."

**Example**:
```
User: "This week I decided to pause paid ads until Month 6, 
and I also decided to change pricing to £149/mo instead of £99."

You (First Response): 
"I see two decisions:

1. Pause paid ads → Mini Format, Medium Impact
   - This is execution/resource allocation, not strategy change
   - If this fails, you just restart ads - only this one thing changes

2. Pricing change £99 → £149 → Full Format, High Impact
   - This changes core business model and vendor acquisition
   - If this fails, entire monetization approach needs rethinking

Here are the formatted entries:

### DEC-011: Pause paid advertising until Month 6 (2025-11-23)

****Decision****: Pause all paid advertising spend until Month 6 to focus budget on organic channels.

****Why****: Current paid ad ROI is unclear with limited conversion data. Better to invest time in SEO and vendor outreach where we can measure results directly. Will revisit paid ads once we have 10+ Premium vendors and clear conversion metrics.

****Expected Outcome****: £300-500/month saved, redirected to Softr/tooling. No measurable traffic loss since paid ads currently <5% of visitors.

****Review Date****: 2026-05-01  
****Actual Outcome****: [To be filled later]

****Impact Level****: Medium  
****Tags****: go-to-market, workflow

---

### DEC-012: Increase Premium pricing from £99/mo to £149/mo (2025-11-23)

****Decision****: Raise Premium tier pricing from £99/month to £149/month per vertical, effective for all new vendors starting December 1, 2025. Grandfather existing Early Bird vendors at £99/mo.

****Context****: [You'll need to provide context - why the change? What prompted this?]

****Rationale****: [You'll need to provide rationale]

****Alternatives Considered****:
- Keep £99/mo: [Why rejected?]
- Go to £199/mo: [Why rejected?]

****Expected Outcome****: [What do you hope happens?]

****Actual Outcome**** (Review Date: 2026-02-23): [To be filled later]

****Impact Level****: High  
****Tags****: pricing, business-model

---

Do you approve these entries? If yes, reply 'Approved - update the log' and I'll add them in my next response.

Note: For DEC-012, I need more details on context, rationale, alternatives, and expected outcome since this is a High Impact decision requiring Full Format."

---

User (approving): "Approved - update the log"

You (Second Response):
"Added DEC-011 and DEC-012 to the Decision Log under 'EXECUTION PHASE DECISIONS' section."
```

---

### When User Requests Outcome Updates

**User says**: "Update outcomes for decisions needing review"

**Your process**:

**Step 1 - Identify and Query** (First response):
1. Scan document for decisions with "Review Date" in the past
2. List them, prioritizing High Impact first
3. For each one, show: DEC number, title, impact level, original expected outcome
4. Ask: "What actually happened with this decision?"
5. **Do not update document yet**

**Step 2 - Format Updates** (After user provides info):
1. User describes what happened
2. Format the "Actual Outcome" section based on their description
3. Show the updated entry
4. Ask if decision succeeded, failed, or was modified
5. If High Impact decision failed, suggest adding to "Decisions Reversed" section
6. **End with**: "Do you approve these updates? If yes, reply 'Approved - update the log'."

**Step 3 - Update Document** (Next response, after approval):
1. User says "Approved - update the log"
2. Update the "Actual Outcome" sections for reviewed decisions
3. If any decisions reversed, add to "DECISIONS REVERSED OR MODIFIED" section
4. Confirm: "Updated outcomes for DEC-XXX, DEC-YYY."

---

### When User Requests Pattern Analysis

**User says**: "Analyze decision patterns for [time period]"

**Your process**:

**Step 1 - Analyze** (First response):
1. Review all decisions in specified time period
2. **Focus especially on High Impact decisions** - these matter most for learning
3. Group by outcome: successful, failed, modified
4. Identify patterns across decisions (e.g., "High Impact tactical pivots succeeded quickly, High Impact strategic changes took 2x longer than expected")
5. Compare expected vs actual outcomes for High Impact decisions
6. Extract 3-5 key lessons that could inform future decisions
7. Format for appropriate "Pattern Recognition" section
8. Show analysis to user
9. **End with**: "Do you approve this analysis? If yes, reply 'Approved - update the log'."

**Step 2 - Update Document** (Next response, after approval):
1. User says "Approved - update the log"
2. Fill the appropriate "Month X-Y Pattern Recognition" section
3. Confirm: "Added pattern analysis for Month X-Y."

---

### When User Requests High Impact Filter

**User says**: "Show me all High Impact decisions from [period]"

**Your process** (This is a query, not an update - no approval needed):
1. Scan document for "Impact Level: High"
2. Filter by time period if specified
3. For each High Impact decision, extract:
   - DEC number and title
   - Date
   - One-line summary (if available) or first sentence of decision
   - Current status (Expected / Reviewed / Reversed)
   - Outcome if reviewed
   - Tags
4. Group by status:
   - Successful (reviewed, positive outcome)
   - Modified or Reversed
   - Pending Review
5. Present in clean format

**Example output**:
```
HIGH IMPACT DECISIONS (Month 1-3):

Reviewed - Successful:
- DEC-008: Request Board Day 1 (2025-11-16)
  Summary: Launched Request Board as core feature
  Outcome: 12 submissions by Month 3, 85% match rate ✓
  Tags: product, differentiation, strategy

Pending Review (Review date passed):
- DEC-005: £99/mo pricing (2025-11-16)
  Summary: Premium tier at £99/mo per vertical
  Review Date: 2026-02-15 (needs update)
  Tags: pricing, business-model

Modified:
- [None in this period]

Total High Impact Decisions: 10
Reviewed: 1
Pending Review: 9
```

---

### DEC Number Management

**Rules** (enforce strictly):
1. DEC numbers start at 001 and increment sequentially
2. Check highest existing number before assigning new number
3. **DEC numbers are permanent** - never reused even if decision is deleted or reversed
4. If decision is reversed, original DEC keeps its number, reversal gets new DEC number
5. Numbers never reordered - always chronological by assignment date

**Example**:
```
DEC-015: Pricing set to £99/mo (later reversed)
...
DEC-023: Pricing changed to £149/mo (reverses DEC-015)

Both keep their numbers. DEC-015 marked as "REVERSED - See DEC-023"`

---

### Tag Usage

**Always use tags from this standard list**:

- strategy
- product
- pricing
- business-model
- content
- vendor
- technical
- workflow
- go-to-market
- ICP
- positioning
- vertical-expansion
- focus
- speed-to-market
- MVP
- differentiation
- monetization
- early-adopters
- productivity
- AI-assisted
- market
- geography

**If user's decision doesn't fit existing tags**:

1. Use closest match from list
2. Or ask user: "This decision doesn't fit standard tags. Should I create new tag '[proposed-tag]' or use '[closest-match]'?"
3. Only create new tags with explicit user approval

**Never create tags spontaneously.**

---

### Impact Level Assignment - Decision Test

**Use this simple test**: "If this decision fails, how much needs to change?"

**High Impact** = Core business elements need to change:

- Entire strategy needs rethinking
- Business model doesn't work
- Value proposition fails
- Major technical platform needs replacement
- Market position fundamentally wrong

**Examples of High**:

- Pricing model (per-vertical vs flat vs per-tool)
- Target market (mid-market vs SMB vs enterprise)
- Core features (Request Board, Editorial Picks)
- Platform choice (Softr vs custom)
- Geographic focus (UK vs US)

**Medium Impact** = Execution approach in one area needs adjustment:

- Process or workflow needs redesign
- Resource allocation shift required
- Tactical approach change needed
- Tool replacement within existing stack

**Examples of Medium**:

- Content production method (AI vs manual)
- Vendor outreach cadence (3/7/14 days vs 5/10/15 days)
- Social media posting frequency
- Email template style
- Feature build order within roadmap

**Low Impact** = Just this one thing needs tweaking:

- Easy to reverse with minimal cost
- Doesn't affect other decisions
- Operational or cosmetic adjustment

**Examples of Low**:

- Button color, layout tweaks
- Meeting schedule changes
- Minor optimization (image compression)
- Documentation format

**When unsure**:

- Default to Medium (most decisions are Medium)
- Ask user: "Would you consider this High, Medium, or Low impact?"

**User can always override** - if user specifies different impact level, use their judgment without question.

## DL-007 – Dual AI Assistant Stack for Development

**Date:** 2025-11-20

**Owner:** Nelson

**Status:** Active

**Decision:**

IndustryLabs will use a combination of **Claude Code (VS Code extension with Sonnet 4.5)** and **GPT-5 / latest GPT models (ChatGPT, OpenAI Codex)** as the primary AI development stack.

**Context:**

- Claude Code is strongest at in-repo navigation, multi-file edits, and applying refactors safely
- GPT-5 is strongest at high-level reasoning, architecture design, TypeScript type work, and documentation
- Other models (Gemini, [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/)) can provide additional perspectives for critical paths
- This dual approach balances speed (autonomous coding) with quality (architectural planning)

**Implementation:**

- Phase 1 (PLAN): Use GPT-5 for architecture and task breakdown
- Phase 2 (IMPLEMENT): Use Claude Code for file creation and edits
- Phase 3 (REVIEW): Use GPT-5 for code review and improvements
- Phase 4 (VALIDATE): Optionally use alternative models for critical paths

**Consequences:**

- All dev tasks in Execution Hub should specify: PLAN / IMPLEMENT / REVIEW phase
- Repo remains single source of truth; AI suggestions must be reconciled with actual codebase
- Credentials and API keys are never pasted into AI chats
- Month 1-3: More manual implementation for learning
- Month 4+: More autonomous implementation for speed

**Review Date:** Month 3 (reassess if tools or workflow needs adjustment)

```tsx
// app/api/new-endpoint/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { z } from "zod";
import { createRecord } from "@/lib/airtable";

// Define validation schema
const schema = z.object({
  field: z.string().min(1),
});

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // Parse and validate
    const body = await req.json();
    const result = schema.safeParse(body);

    if (!result.success) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { success: false, error: "Validation failed" },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    // Write to Airtable
    const record = await createRecord("TABLE_NAME", result.data);

    return NextResponse.json(
      { success: true, id: record.id },
      { status: 201 }
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState, FormEvent } from "react";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";

export function MyForm() {
  const [values, setValues] = useState({ field: "" });
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [success, setSuccess] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setError(null);
    setIsSubmitting(true);

    try {
      const res = await fetch("/api/endpoint", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(values),
      });

      const data = await res.json();

      if (!res.ok || !data.success) {
        setError(data.error || "Failed");
        return;
      }

      setSuccess(true);
      setValues({ field: "" }); // Reset
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Network error");
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <Label htmlFor="field">Field</Label>
        <Input
          id="field"
          value={values.field}
          onChange={(e) => setValues({ ...values, field: e.target.value })}
          disabled={isSubmitting}
        />
      </div>

      {error && <p className="text-red-600">{error}</p>}
      {success && <p className="text-green-600">Success!</p>}

      <Button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
