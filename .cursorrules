# IndustryLabs.ai Development Rules

## Project Context
- B2B AI tools marketplace organized by industry verticals (HR, L&D, CS)
- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Airtable backend (9 tables: TOOLS, VENDORS, REQUESTS, CATEGORIES, ARTICLES, etc.)
- Target: £5-8K MRR by Month 12 (Yellow Zone success)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Airtable API (via lib/airtable.ts wrapper)
- Hosting: Vercel
- Email: ConvertKit
- Analytics: Google Analytics 4

## Development Principles (Month 1-3)
- Use CLIENT COMPONENTS primarily to learn React fundamentals
- Server Components can be introduced later (Month 4+)
- Task-based work, not time-based
- Ship before perfect
- Focus on HR vertical only until Gate 1 (Month 3)

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components with hooks
- Tailwind utility classes (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- shadcn/ui components for UI primitives
- Meaningful variable names (no x, y, z)

## File Structure
- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/app/api` - API routes (e.g., /api/request for form submissions)
- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/lib` - Utilities and API wrappers (airtable.ts)
- `/public` - Static assets
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions

## Key Routes
- `/` - Homepage
- `/hr-talent` - HR & Talent category page
- `/hr-talent/[slug]` - Subcategory pages (e.g., /hr-talent/ats)
- `/tools/[slug]` - Individual tool detail pages
- `/articles/[slug]` - Article/blog pages
- `/request-board` - Request Board form
- `/api/request` - API endpoint for Request Board submissions

## Airtable Integration
- All data fetched server-side via lib/airtable.ts
- Never expose Airtable API key to client
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Cache strategies TBD (can implement later)

## Current Phase: Month 0 (Pre-launch)
- Status: Foundation setup in progress
- Next milestone: Month 1 (Dec 2025) - 8-10 tools live, 1-3 paying vendors
- Focus: Build fast, learn React, get to revenue quickly

## AI Assistant Strategy

IndustryLabs uses multiple AI coding assistants in combination:

**Primary Tools:**
- **Claude Code** (VS Code extension) - Claude Sonnet 4.5 for autonomous coding
  - Multi-file navigation and edits inside the repo
  - Implementing features in existing code structure
  - Refactors, migrations, and repetitive boilerplate work
  
- **GPT-5 / Latest GPT Models** (ChatGPT, OpenAI Codex) - for high-level reasoning
  - System design, architecture decisions, and trade-off analysis
  - Complex TypeScript typing, API design, and edge-case reasoning
  - Generating or reviewing important docs (README, ADRs, specs)

**Optional:**
- **Other models** (e.g., Gemini, Claude.ai) for cross-checking tricky logic or security-sensitive flows

**Rules for Any AI Assistant:**

1. **Source of Truth:** The GitHub repo is the single source of truth. Never assume files that don't exist.

2. **Task Allocation:** When proposing work, explicitly state which assistant should handle which part:
   - "Use Claude Code in VS Code to apply these multi-file changes"
   - "Use GPT-5 to review the architecture and suggest improvements"

3. **Security:** Never expose or hard-code secrets. All credentials live in `.env.local` and are never pasted into AI chats.

4. **Incremental Changes:** Prefer small, incremental changes with clear commit messages over large unreviewed rewrites.

5. **Assistant Roles:** Clearly state whether you are in PLAN, IMPLEMENT, or REVIEW mode.

**Development Workflow:**
1. **Planning** → Use GPT-5 for architecture, breaking down tasks, identifying risks
2. **Implementation** → Use Claude Code for file creation, multi-file edits, refactoring
3. **Review** → Use GPT-5 for code review, naming suggestions, test recommendations
4. **Cross-check** → Optionally use other models for critical paths

Development is done using BOTH Claude Code (for in-repo edits) and GPT-5/latest GPT models (for planning/review). Any AI assistant should explicitly state which role it is playing.
